First they created a five-sign code, with a certain one corresponding to the real call (based on the hitter’s jersey number and the number of balls thrown in the at-bat). According to their calculations, it would take a neural network more than 16,000 at-bats to catch on to the system. The trio got an A for their work. Unfortunately, the MIT baseball team didn’t adopt their approach, though the players did start rotating their combos more often. Selling pro teams might prove even more difficult: Catchers and pitchers don’t have the capacity to do math in a game, and the improvised signing could cause miscommunications. Besides, players and coaches switch sides often, and a code would only be good until word got out."},{"_id":"PR5V5JFSKRBZHPHUVV3F7IMLNM","type":"text","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"inline_comments":[],"_id":1580303025602},"content":"The league has also put some thought into warding off sign stealers.
