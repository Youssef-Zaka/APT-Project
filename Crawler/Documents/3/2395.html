Three team managers connected with the Houston sign-stealing scandal have now been dismissed, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200131222742/https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2870185-mlbs-war-on-sign-stealing-shifts-to-alex-cora-and-the-boston-red-sox">Boston Red Sox, the 2018 World Series champions, are also under investigation</a>. More recently, rumors have spread that multiple Astros wore miniature buzzers at the plate, though no damning evidence has surfaced. What is clear is that MLB is up against a major reckoning. “There’s a belief that is treated by players and staff as fact: That illegal sign stealing, particularly through advanced technology, is everywhere,” <i>Athletic</i> reporters Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drellich <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200131222742/https://theathletic.com/1363451/2019/11/12/the-astros-stole-signs-electronically-in-2017-part-of-a-much-broader-issue-for-major-league-baseball/">wrote back in November</a>. New gadgets and computers will give the cheaters of tomorrow the power to predict opponents’ moves, conceal communications, and threaten norms across pro sports.

First they created a five-sign code, with a certain one corresponding to the real call (based on the hitter’s jersey number and the number of balls thrown in the at-bat). According to their calculations, it would take a neural network more than 16,000 at-bats to catch on to the system. The trio got an A for their work. Unfortunately, the MIT baseball team didn’t adopt their approach, though the players did start rotating their combos more often. Selling pro teams might prove even more difficult: Catchers and pitchers don’t have the capacity to do math in a game, and the improvised signing could cause miscommunications. Besides, players and coaches switch sides often, and a code would only be good until word got out.</p></div></section></div><div class="margin_vertical"><section class="content"><div><p class="paragraph | margin_bottom_lg margin_centered">The league has also put some thought into warding off sign stealers.

First they created a five-sign code, with a certain one corresponding to the real call (based on the hitter’s jersey number and the number of balls thrown in the at-bat). According to their calculations, it would take a neural network more than 16,000 at-bats to catch on to the system. The trio got an A for their work. Unfortunately, the MIT baseball team didn’t adopt their approach, though the players did start rotating their combos more often. Selling pro teams might prove even more difficult: Catchers and pitchers don’t have the capacity to do math in a game, and the improvised signing could cause miscommunications.
