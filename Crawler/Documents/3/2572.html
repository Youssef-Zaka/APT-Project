        "description": "\u2013 Women remain dramatically underrepresented in the engineering profession and far fewer women than men persist in the field. This study aims to identify individual and contextual factors that distinguish women who persist in engineering careers in the US.  \u2013 Qualitative research was conducted based on semi\u2010structured interviews with 31 women engineers, ten of whom had left an engineering career and 21 persisting for on average 21 years. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded and analyzed.  \u2013 Women who persisted in engineering careers articulated high levels of self efficacy, described themselves in terms of their identity as an engineer, and were motivated by the challenges and novelty of the profession. Women engineers' ability to adapt enabled them to persist and thrive despite working in a male\u2010dominated culture characterized by difficulties associated with the workplace, including discrimination. Women who opted out of engineering were less likely to recognize options in navigating the workplace and some felt as if they were pushed into engineering. Persistent engineers were less likely to be married and had fewer children.  \u2013 Although appropriate for an inductive study using a grounded theory approach the sample was small and the data was self reported.  \u2013 A model is developed that integrates individual and contextual factors explaining a woman's persistence in an engineering career and has potential to explain persistence in other professions. To retain more women in engineering careers, organizations and managers should provide opportunities to develop identified skills within the professional domain and should provide opportunities for women engineers that provide continuous learning, on\u2010going challenges and novel work.  \u2013 Although numerous studies have addressed the retention of women in academic engineering programs and several recent studies have described why women leave engineering careers, the novelty of this study is that it addresses why women stay.",

This study aims to identify individual and contextual factors that distinguish women who persist in engineering careers in the US., – Qualitative research was conducted based on semi‐structured interviews with 31 women engineers, ten of whom had left an engineering career and 21 persisting for on average 21 years. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded and analyzed., – Women who persisted in engineering careers articulated high levels of self efficacy, described themselves in terms of their identity as an engineer, and were motivated by the challenges and novelty of the profession. Women engineers&#039; ability to adapt enabled them to persist and thrive despite working in a male‐dominated culture characterized by difficulties associated with the workplace, including discrimination. Women who opted out of engineering were less likely to recognize options in navigating the workplace and some felt as if they were pushed into engineering. Persistent engineers were less likely to be married and had fewer children., – Although appropriate for an inductive study using a grounded theory approach the sample was small and the data was self reported., – A model is developed that integrates individual and contextual factors explaining a woman&#039;s persistence in an engineering career and has potential to explain persistence in other professions. To retain more women in engineering careers, organizations and managers should provide opportunities to develop identified skills within the professional domain and should provide opportunities for women engineers that provide continuous learning, on‐going challenges and novel work., – Although numerous studies have addressed the retention of women in academic engineering programs and several recent studies have described why women leave engineering careers, the novelty of this study is that it addresses why women stay.">          <meta name="dc.Date" scheme="WTN8601" content="2013-05-17Z">          <meta name="dc.Type" content="article">          <meta name="dc.Format" content="text/html">          <meta name="dc.Identifier" scheme="doi" content="10.1108/CDI-11-2012-0108">          <meta name="dc.Identifier" scheme="issn" content="1362-0436">                  <meta name="dc.Identifier" scheme="original-pdf" content="cdi-11-2012-0108.pdf">          <meta name="dc.Language" content="en">          <meta name="dc.Coverage" content="world">          <meta name="keywords" content="Women engineers,Career decisions,Persistence,STEM women,Women,United States of America">          <meta name="dc.Publisher" content="Emerald Group Publishing Limited">          <meta name="DCTERMS.bibliographicCitation" scheme="KEV.ctx" content="&amp;ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.spage=139&amp;rft.epage=154&amp;rft.volume=18&amp;rft.issue=2">

                    <section id="idm44806878246624" tabindex="0"><h2 class="intent_subheading">Introduction</h2><p>Since the 1970s the number of women employed in the USA has increased to where in 2010 women comprised 51 percent of all management, professional and related occupations, 46 percent of those employed in life, physical, and social science occupations, 67 percent of psychologists, 60 percent of accountants, 53 percent of pharmacists, 32 percent of lawyers, 32 percent of physicians and surgeons, 25 percent of dentists, and 24 percent of architects (<a href="#b7" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b7" alt="" title="">BLS, 2011</a>).</p><p>Despite substantial gains in these professions women remain underrepresented in engineering constituting only 10 percent of full‐time employed engineers and 7.7 percent of engineering managers (<a href="#b7" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b7" alt="" title="">BLS, 2011</a>) at a time when demand for engineers continues to grow (<a href="#b6" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b6" alt="" title="">BLS, 2009</a>). Numerous studies have been undertaken to understand how to recruit middle school and high school girls to engineering while other studies have focused on retaining women in academic programs (<a href="#b4" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b4" alt="" title="">Bilimoria <em>et al.</em>, 2008</a>; <a href="#b8" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b8" alt="" title="">Blum, 2001</a>; <a href="#b9" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b9" alt="" title="">Cech <em>et al.</em>, 2011</a>; <a href="#b27" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b27" alt="" title="">National Academies Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy, 2007</a>; <a href="#b3" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b3" alt="" title="">Betz and Hackett, 1981</a>; <a href="#b16" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b16" alt="" title="">Hackett <em>et al.</em>, 1992</a>). These studies have shown success in that the number of women graduating with engineering degrees at all levels has increased from less than 5 percent in 1980 to 22 percent in 2008 (<a href="#b28" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b28" alt="" title="">NSF, 2008</a>).</p><p>With more than 2.4 million employed engineers in the USA and 83 percent of these working in industry or business (<a href="#b29" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b29" alt="" title="">NSF, 2011</a>) surprisingly few studies have focused on women engineers in industry. Among the few studies on non‐academic women engineers most are concerned with why women leave the engineering profession with <a href="#b18" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b18" alt="" title="">Hewlett <em>et al.</em> (2008)</a> describing it as a hostile and macho domain where women are isolated and marginalized. More than two‐thirds of women leave engineering 15‐years post degree which is double the rate of men (<a href="#b13" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b13" alt="" title="">Frehill, 2008</a>). To retain more women in engineering the studies suggest improvements to the cultural and organizational aspects, for example <a href="#b12" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b12" alt="" title="">Fouad and Singh (2011)</a> recommend creating a culture within organizations that values women engineers' contributions by providing clear paths towards advancement, offering opportunities for mentoring both formal and informal, and supporting work‐life balance.</p><p>Our research has taken the approach of focusing on women in industry and hypothesizing that women who persist in engineering, a technology driven and male‐dominated profession, have unique characteristics that promote their commitment to the profession post‐degree. This qualitative study is based on semi‐structured interviews with women engineers with considerable experience working in industry in the USA. Informed by prior research and preliminary interviews with professionals knowledgable about the problem of practice, we conjectured that both individual and contextual factors might influence career persistence, but we remained purposefully open to discovering if, how and why they did. The results reflect assessment of the experiences not only of persistent engineers but of a second sample of women with an average of 12 years of engineering practice who left the profession to pursue other career opportunities. Comparing and contrasting evocative personal narratives from both groups enriched our understanding of the research question:</p><p><em>RQ.</em> What factors explain career persistence of women engineers in industry in the USA?</p><p>The answer to this question may help to recruit and retain more women to STEM careers. Doing so, it is argued, will benefit women, industry and society (<a href="#b25" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b25" alt="" title="">Margolis <em>et al.</em>, 1999/2000</a>). For women the gain is high paying and rewarding work with abundant opportunities (<a href="#b5" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b5" alt="" title="">BLS, 2006</a>); for industry a reduction in the troublesome shortage of skilled technical workers in the USA (<a href="#b29" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b29" alt="" title="">NSF, 2011</a>); and for society the broadened perspective and diversified talent women bring to the field (<a href="#b25" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b25" alt="" title="">Margolis <em>et al.</em>, 1999/2000</a>).</p></section>
                    <section id="idm44806878219168" tabindex="0"><h2 class="intent_subheading">Theory base of study</h2><p>The rationale for this study on women's persistence in the engineering profession is based on the social cognitive career theory (SCCT) (<a href="#b23" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b23" alt="" title="">Lent <em>et al.</em>, 1994</a>) which identifies both individual and contextual factors to explain the choice of undergraduate majors principally those associated with STEM careers. The SCCT was later updated by <a href="#b22" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b22" alt="" title="">Lent (2005)</a> to address career development decisions. SCCT provides a framework for understanding career decisions including interests, career choice, and persistence in educational pursuits. While initially developed to address career entry for those in late adolescence there is potential for the use of SCCT in examining the persistence of women in engineering careers.</p><p>Informed by <a href="#b2" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b2" alt="" title="">Bandura's (1986)</a> social cognitive theory, SCCT addresses the dynamics involved with individual factors surrounded by an ever‐changing environment or culture to predict outcomes. The recognition that people can change and will change separates this theory from others and provides its value in understanding how careers decisions are made. Individuals can and do assert agency in the decisions impacting their careers (<a href="#b22" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b22" alt="" title="">Lent, 2005</a>) and this theory allows for changing life roles and the salience of these roles for individuals related to their career options.</p><p>The influences of precursors on career choice are included in SCCT and are thought to impact the individual factors. These individual factors include self‐efficacy and outcome expectations which impact career interests and choice goals that motivate action toward performance. Contextual factors moderate the influence of interests on goals as well as the influence of goals on actions. Performance may then influence learning experiences which feedback and impact self‐efficacy and outcome expectations.</p><p>SCCT takes into account the potential effect of environmental factors, including how career interests are impacted, for example, by social norms which are thought to be important to the persistence of women in the engineering profession. Because psychological and social effects of gender have been linked to career interests and choice from the social and cultural context in which the individuals are socialized and from which they may see opportunities, there may be an impact on a woman's career decisions. <a href="#b22" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b22" alt="" title="">Lent (2005)</a> posits that gender may influence career decisions as the development of self‐efficacy and outcomes expectations may depend on how one is socialized. Gender role socialization has been shown to bias the beliefs and expectations that boys and girls have around male or female‐dominated professions leading to outcomes culturally defined as appropriated for their own gender (<a href="#b15" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b15" alt="" title="">Hackett and Betz, 1981</a>). Gender as well as other socially constructed influences can limit career interests and may impact the opportunities and affect an individual's career goals (<a href="#b22" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b22" alt="" title="">Lent, 2005</a>).</p><p>The objective of this study was to identify factors that influence a woman's persistence in the engineering profession, recognizing that such factors may be useful in efforts to retain women in this profession.

As such, our research design includes interviews with both women who persisted in an engineering career as well as those who chose to leave to explore those factors that differentiate the two groups.</p><section id="idm44806871940192" tabindex="0"><h3 class="intent_subheading">Sample</h3><p>Our sample consisted of 31 women aged 34‐60, all with experience as an engineer or as a manager of engineering or manager of any technical area within a corporation located in the USA. All of the respondents were identified through the personal network of the primary researcher who had worked as an engineer for more than 25 years in four <em>Fortune 500</em> corporations. Some of the respondents were former classmates, others were work colleagues, and others were friends of friends. At the time of the interviews the primary researcher had neither seen nor worked with any of the respondents for at least three years. In all cases women were recruited to the study using either an introductory e‐mail or phone call asking the respondent to participate in the interview.</p><p>Specific undergraduate degrees of the respondents included one in science and 30 in engineering: biomedical (one), chemical (12), civil (four), industrial (four), electrical (two) material/metallurgical (two), or mechanical (five). More than half of the women had Master's degrees − nine in engineering, seven MBA's, one masters of education, and one masters in counseling. Three had doctorates (two in engineering, one in management) and two others were in the process of obtaining doctorates.</p><p>At the time of the interviews, 21 of the women had been working in a technical role for an average of 21 years. These persistent women engineers had never chosen to leave an engineering career and were either still working as an engineer or were in a management role normally afforded those with a successful engineering career behind them. The remaining ten women had chosen to leave an engineering or technical management career prior to the time of the study after an average of 12 years of experience. Six had exited for non‐engineering careers; the four others to be stay‐at‐home mothers. Employer industries included: chemical, pharmaceutical, electronics, oil, food, metals, fluid technology, communications, electronics, entertainment, consumer products, automobile manufacturers, automobile suppliers, and consulting. A summary of key personal data on the respondents is provided in <a href="#F_1370180202002" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_figure_link Link__fig" data-target="F_1370180202002" alt="Personal data" title="Personal data">Table I</a>.</p></section><section id="idm44806871936400" tabindex="0"><h3 class="intent_subheading">Data collection and analysis</h3><p>The data was collected during a four‐month period from May to August 2009. 31 semi‐structured interviews of approximately one hour duration were conducted. An interview protocol, designed a priori, was used to guide the interviews but, consistent with the semi‐structured approach to interviewing, respondents were allowed freedom of expression. The key interview questions focused on personal and career histories, examples of fulfilling and non‐fulfilling career experiences, early and current career expectations, and beliefs about the pros and cons of an engineering career for a woman. Women currently employed in engineering were also asked to explain their persistence and women who left engineering were asked why they opted‐out. All respondents were candid and forthcoming as evidenced by their detailed and in‐depth stories which were oftentimes imbued with raw emotion. Many expressed the desire to influence younger women by their own positive and negative experiences.</p><p>The data analysis began with repeatedly listening to each audio recording and reviewing each interview transcript numerous times. A software program, <em>Qualrus v2.1.0.0</em> (<a href="#b20" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b20" alt="" title="">Idea Works Inc., 2002</a>) was used to code and analyze the data. Using a software package is particularly helpful when there is a large amount of data as the software performs basic statistical analysis allowing the researchers to be aware of the highest ranking emergent themes and key words. Initially, we identified almost 1,800 words, phrases or longer segments of text and assigned to them 151 codes. Further refinement and reduction yielded 49 codes. Most of these codes were related to career theory, for example from the SCCT we used codes such as “self efficacy expectations” and “outcome expectations”. Using these codes we compared the two groups of women, those who persisted and those who did not, and identified individual and contextual differences between the two groups to yield our findings. These findings were reviewed and validated by four researchers to check for reliability and consistency.</p></section></section>

The individual factors included self‐efficacy, identity as an engineer, other orientation, adaptability and engagement in work. Contextual experiences related to a woman's choice of engineering, work experiences as an engineer; and the family situation as summarized in <a href="#F_1370180202003" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_figure_link Link__fig" data-target="F_1370180202003" alt="Findings summary" title="Findings summary">Table II</a>.</p><section id="idm44806871929856" tabindex="0"><h3 class="intent_subheading">Self‐efficacy</h3><p>Each of the persistent engineers narrated experiences in which they demonstrated initiative and seized control of or manipulated difficult situations drawing upon what they judged as superior capabilities and/or training to effect personally favorable outcomes. Self‐efficacy was expressed in relation to finding new assignments, dealing with difficult work situations, or tackling tough technical problems. Often it was associated with the employment of skills developed over the course of a career to maneuver out of an uncomfortable or threatening situation. Examples included managing conflict with superiors or coworkers and effecting formal job changes. Additionally we found self‐efficacy expressed in relation to balancing work and life demands.</p><p>In contrast, nine of the ten engineers who had exited the field, told stories in which uncertainty, confusion, self‐doubt or low confidence predominated as shown in the comparative quotes in <a href="#F_1370180202004" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_figure_link Link__fig" data-target="F_1370180202004" alt="Specific quotes related to self&#x2010;efficacy and confidence" title="Specific quotes related to self&#x2010;efficacy and confidence">Table III</a>.</p></section><section id="idm44806871927504" tabindex="0"><h3 class="intent_subheading">Identity</h3><p>Persistent engineers are more likely than out‐opting engineers to describe their attributes, values and experiences in terms of their identity as a professional engineer:<blockquote class="intent_quote blockquote Section__quote"><p>I'm a hopeless geek.

What distinguished the two groups was the way these experiences were framed and addressed. 16 of the persistent engineers discussed purposeful ways they adapted to the culture, but only two of ten women who left referenced adaptation and those who left were more likely to complain about the organizational culture.</p><p>Adaptation in some cases was subtle – “dressing down,” “pulling my hair back” or “changing the tone of my voice”. More often persistent engineers reported actively manipulating circumstances in an effort to mitigate personal discomfort caused by gender bias – bettering their own situations and, sometimes, affecting the attitudes and behaviors of others. The two quotes below contrast; in the first a persistent engineer describes how she challenged a discriminatory situation by addressing it, while in the next a woman who left engineering describes a similar situation to which she failed to respond:<blockquote class="intent_quote blockquote Section__quote"><p>I took the exam and then I was told that I didn't get the job, but I had gotten the highest score. So, I petitioned the city and went in and I made him tell me why he thought I wasn't qualified for the job. And it ended up that they had to reverse it and give me the job.

In many cases the women talked about the effects or consequences of their professional efforts on customers, co‐workers, or direct reports. Exemplifying the broader societal effects of her work, one woman provided a narrative of how software developed by her team saved the lives of US military operatives in a foreign country and possibly her brother:<blockquote class="intent_quote blockquote Section__quote"><p>So they had integrated our situation awareness (software) with their targeting capability […] and there was a squadron of gunships that were flying missions into Afghanistan […] And my brother flies gunships and he was in Afghanistan and there's only one active duty gunship squadron […] so they re‐vectored either my brother or somebody close to him (Consultant with 28 years experience).</p></blockquote></p><p>In contrast, women who opted‐out were less likely to discuss their careers in terms of reciprocal engagement with others, instead they discussed their career experiences in terms of returns to themselves frequently associating fulfillment with recognition by others, usually a higher level manager. These women focused on what they personally learned, felt, experienced or contributed to the job:<blockquote class="intent_quote blockquote Section__quote"><p>I was working hard. I believed you had to work hard to do good work. That was being recognized, and I was being rewarded. So that was a pattern that I was in, and I have an ego, so I also was getting that fed by being rewarded, and I needed that.

Most revealed being motivated and challenged by opportunities to work on new technologies, projects, or products – opportunities some found within the scope of their organizations, and others purposefully sought in different firms:<blockquote class="intent_quote blockquote Section__quote"><p>They were giving me assignments that were brand new, Greenfield, nobody had done before.

Conversely, women who opted‐out articulated a tension between work‐related and personal goals, often citing the need to fulfill personal aspirations not satisfied by work as the motivation for leaving their jobs. The persistent engineers, even after many years on the job, exude enthusiasm, energy and commitment to their work:<blockquote class="intent_quote blockquote Section__quote"><p>I can feel like I did something that made a difference […] I can look around and go, yeah, I impacted the world a little bit (Technical Manager with 17 years experience).</p></blockquote></p><p>The women who left described their experience as engineers as “not happy,” “didn't feel I was giving back,” “had accomplished nothing,” and felt “detached”:<blockquote class="intent_quote blockquote Section__quote"><p>What am I doing with my kids?

Persistent engineers, however, were more likely to discuss their choice of engineering in terms of their own interests:<blockquote class="intent_quote blockquote Section__quote"><p>I […] was very good at math and science […] it just always came easy for me.

Among those in both groups who had children, persistent engineers had fewer. Both groups of women discussed being offered or having considered working part‐time or flexible hours. At the time of our interviews two persistent engineers were working less than full‐time to care for young children, and two others had previously worked part‐time. Among the out‐opting engineers, two discussed working part time during their engineering careers and discussed the option for flexible work schedules at the time they choose to leave engineering.</p><p>The data revealed no differences between the groups related to the role of husbands or partners in decisions regarding child care or in the woman's decision to persist or opt out of the profession; however three of our persistent engineers were married to stay‐at‐home dads. Each woman discussed unique aspects of obtaining child care covering all available options from using family members (cousins, mothers or mother‐in‐law) to day care facilities.</p></section><section id="idm44806871907024" tabindex="0"><h3 class="intent_subheading">Work environment</h3><p>Both persistent engineers and those that left the profession acknowledged the male‐dominated culture of their workplaces and both groups noted challenges associated with it. 17 of 21 women who remained in engineering and seven of ten women who exited discussed gender associated cultural issues including, in some cases, discrimination and/or harassment:<blockquote class="intent_quote blockquote Section__quote"><p>I didn't get that next job up.

Some of the engineers described relationships with formal and/or informal mentors, but again, no pattern was found linking a mentor to career persistence.</p><p>Many of the women discussed working within different industries:<blockquote class="intent_quote blockquote Section__quote"><p>I've worked in so many different industries and businesses, everything from children's hospitals […] utility companies, telecommunication companies (Project Manager with 13 years experience).</p></blockquote></p><p>or teams that were comprised of women from other occupations, such as accounting, marketing and sales with traditionally higher representation of women:<blockquote class="intent_quote blockquote Section__quote"><p>I still go to a lot of meetings where I'm the only woman in the room.

Those who worked in manufacturing were most likely to discuss the paucity of other women in their day to day work. Others discussed the changing role of, and challenges associated with, being a woman in engineering:<blockquote class="intent_quote blockquote Section__quote"><p>I'd call it a challenge – is there still a stigma out there for women in engineering?

                    <section id="idm44806871898192" tabindex="0"><h2 class="intent_subheading">Model of career persistence</h2><p>Notable differences in individual and contextual factors associated with long tenured women engineers versus those who opted out of the profession were revealed in this study. These findings show that women who persist in an engineering career differ from those opting out of engineering due to the following individual factors: high levels of self‐efficacy related to engineering and their work‐life balance, identity as an engineer expressed in both work and life situations, the ability to adapt to work culture and experiences, an orientation towards others in work environments and engagement in work that yields purpose and fulfillment as an engineer.</p><p>Women who persisted in engineering expressed their career choice as their own unlike out‐opting engineers who were more likely to have discussed being pushed into an engineering career. Proximal contextual factors related to persistence consist of the work environment and the family environment including marital status and number of children. While both women who persisted in engineering and those who opted out describe difficult work environments including discrimination and harassment, women who opted out blame this culture for exiting, a finding similar to that of previous research including <a href="#b12" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b12" alt="" title="">Fouad and Singh (2011)</a> and <a href="#b18" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b18" alt="" title="">Hewlett <em>et al.</em> (2008)</a>.</p><p>A framework is proposed that integrates these findings into a model to explain career persistence as shown in <a href="#F_1370180202001" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_figure_link Link__fig" data-target="F_1370180202001" alt="Career persistence model" title="Career persistence model">Figure 1</a>.</p><p>The career persistence model utilizes the concept of individual and contextual factors from the SCCT (<a href="#b22" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b22" alt="" title="">Lent, 2005</a>), includes <a href="#b19" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b19" alt="" title="">Ibarra's (1999)</a> description of identity especially related to women (<a href="#b11" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b11" alt="" title="">Ely <em>et al.</em>, 2011</a>) and <a href="#b21" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b21" alt="" title="">Kahn's (1990)</a> concept of work engagement. According to the career persistence model, career choice factors influence the individual factors of self‐efficacy, identity, adaptability, other orientation and work engagement which are moderated by work and family contextual factors leading to persistence in a career.</p><p>The model applies to both those who persist and those who opt out as we found that women who opted out of engineering expressed lower levels of self‐efficacy in relation to their engineering career, frustration with the male‐dominated culture of engineering, more unease related to their ability to balance work and family, and lack of fulfillment within engineering career.</p><p>Although knowledge and skills are necessary for effective performance, self‐referent thought mediates the relationship between knowledge and action (<a href="#b1" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b1" alt="" title="">Bandura, 1982</a>) and how individuals judge their capabilities impacts their motivation and behavior. Undoubtedly all the women in our study had the knowledge and skills necessary to be an engineer as evidenced by their engineering degree(s) as well as their own ability to work as an engineer for at least eight years prior to our study. The women who persisted in engineering discussed the novelty and challenges associated with their engineering careers as their motivation to stay. The women who left discussed their need to find fulfillment outside of engineering, some because of the work and the culture of engineering, others because they realized another calling.</p><p>The concept of professional role confidence, introduced by <a href="#b9" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b9" alt="" title="">Cech <em>et al.</em> (2011)</a>, relates to gendered persistence in engineering where professional role confidence is described as an ability to not only successfully perform the professional role but to also find enjoyment and fulfillment in this role. The persistence of undergraduate students in engineering was found to be significantly associated with professional role confidence, where men developed this more successfully than women. Where <a href="#b9" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b9" alt="" title="">Cech <em>et al.</em> (2011)</a> used professional role confidence to explain persistence in undergraduate engineering, the concept of professional role confidence clearly blends self‐efficacy within engineering with work engagement in an engineering role providing further support for our model of persistence in the engineering profession.</p><p>The transition to a professional career from a student and confidence within this role can be explained in terms of identity formation. <a href="#b19" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b19" alt="" title="">Ibarra (1999, p. 765)</a> describes identity as the “constellation of attributes, beliefs, values, motives and experiences in terms of which people define themselves.” Professional identity has been discussed in relation to career and career transitions by <a href="#b19" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b19" alt="" title="">Ibarra (1999)</a> where she hypothesizes that adaptation processes shape identity formation within careers and especially during career transitions where various selves are tested for possible or provisional use. Adaptation is used to improve the fit between a person and the work environment with identity changing over time as difficulties and demands of roles impact one's notion of identity. For the women in our study, those who persisted identified as an engineer and were able to adapt to improve the fit of the engineering profession to themselves. Ibarra's discussion of provisional selves provides support for the model of career persistence and helps to explain how some women persist while others opt‐out.</p><p>The model for career persistence has been proposed using arguments similar those of <a href="#b11" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b11" alt="" title="">Ely <em>et al.</em> (2011)</a> who offer a framework for women's leadership development. Based on theories related to both gender and leadership, this framework shows how “gender shapes women's path to leadership without either victimizing or blaming women” (<a href="#b11" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b11" alt="" title="">Ely <em>et al.</em>, 2011, p. 475)</a>. Powerful but invisible barriers exist that limit women's opportunities because of cultural beliefs about gender, workplace structure and patterns that inadvertently favor men. To overcome this so‐called second generation form of gender bias women are encouraged to construct and internalize a leadership identity while in the process of becoming a leader. Developing as a leader is identity work and subtle forms of gender bias impact a woman's ability to develop an identity as a leader.</p><p>Our study provides support for theorizing that an ability to develop an identity as an engineer leads to persistence in an engineering career. In the same way that <a href="#b11" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b11" alt="" title="">Ely <em>et al.</em> (2011)</a> argue that this gender bias impacts a woman's ability to see themselves as leaders we argue that as engineering is almost always associated with men and engineering continues to be male‐dominated, women may have difficulty constructing and internalizing an identity as an engineer.</p><p>The persistent engineers in our study adapted and experienced engineering in a manner that facilitated the development of an identity of an engineer through adaptation, collaboration, and alignment of professional and personal aspirations. Further, we found that the persistent women engineers are highly connected to their occupations and strongly engaged in their work. <a href="#b21" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b21" alt="" title="">Kahn (1990)</a>, credited with first defining the term engagement in a work role, states that personal engagement is the degree to which people bring in their own selves while performing work tasks. While engaged at work, employees express themselves physically, cognitively, and emotionally while performing work roles.</p><p>An interesting outcome of this study is that no pattern was shown where persistence was influenced by support from the manager or from the husband/partner. Both groups discussed having options for work flexibility particularly with part time work when they became mothers. That the sample included women mostly working in large multinational corporations may explain these findings. As discussed by <a href="#b17" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b17" alt="" title="">Hammer <em>et al.</em> (2011)</a> organizations have adopted many work‐family policies and these policies are more common in professional positions which include engineering.</p><p>Women who persisted in engineering were less likely to be married and had fewer children than women who opted out of engineering and several women discussed their decision to opt out of engineering in relation to their family needs. For women, career decisions are made while considering the impact of these decisions on others (<a href="#b24" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b24" alt="" title="">Mainiero and Sullivan, 2005</a>) and family circumstances may intervene in a woman's decision to persist in an engineering career.</p></section>
                    <section id="idm44806871865104" tabindex="0"><h2 class="intent_subheading">Conclusion and implications</h2><p>The findings from this study show that the reasons women persist in engineering are not the opposite of those reasons other researchers have identified as why women opt out. Where others have found that the cultural aspects of an engineering career cause women to leave the profession, these findings show that women in engineering experience difficulties related to the male‐dominated aspects of engineering but women who persist are able to overcome these difficulties enabling them to find fulfilling and rewarding experiences in the engineering profession.</p><section id="idm44806875050848" tabindex="0"><h3 class="intent_subheading">Recommendations for further research</h3><p>A theoretical model that integrates individual and contextual factors has been developed that explains a woman's persistence in an engineering career and has potential to explain persistence in other professions. Since our sample was small a larger study is recommended using a survey method to corroborate these findings.</p><p>Researchers should continue to explore reasons why women persist in a male‐dominated profession and how individual factors such as self‐efficacy and adaptability are developed within these professions. Studies are recommended that explore the relationships between the factors uncovered in this study, for example how self‐efficacy relates to work engagement.</p></section><section id="idm44806875049104" tabindex="0"><h3 class="intent_subheading">Implications for practice</h3><p>The retention of women in engineering and other STEM careers may be improved if organizations, managers and women engineers make use of these findings. Organizations that recognize the importance of a woman's family as well as the skills necessary to persist in a male‐dominated work environment are more likely to retain women. Organizations and managers providing opportunities to develop the skills identified in this study within the professional domain, as well as challenge, novelty, and learning in work assignments, and those that are supportive of the family circumstances of women are more likely to retain women in engineering.</p><p>Women are encouraged to assess their own skills and to seek opportunities to continuously improve. Interventions may be effective in developing individual skills related to persistence in the profession. For example, numerous studies have proven that self‐efficacy is developed and can be improved by one or a combination of four mechanisms: performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion and psychological states (<a href="#b1" class="text-link scroll_to Link intent_bibliographic_link Link__bibr" data-target="b1" alt="" title="">Bandura, 1982</a>). In this regard, a variety of professional organizations offer opportunities for developing and improving skills important in the engineering profession.</p><p>Women engineers should actively engage with their work environment and continually seek opportunities for challenge, novelty and growth within the scope of their work. The impact of family on a woman's career has been shown to influence a woman's persistence in an engineering career and we learned how some women changed jobs or employers to achieve balance between work and family. As a result women who may be struggling with the demands of an engineering career and a family should seek more supportive jobs or employers instead of exiting the engineering profession.</p></section></section>
