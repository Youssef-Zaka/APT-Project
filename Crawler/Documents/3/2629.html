	  These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.   That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved.  
<br><br>
Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors.
<br><br>
The goal is to <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2013/10/25/fixing-broken-links/">fix all broken links on the web</a>.

While others are implementing complex fluid dynamics unintentionally, Bauer studies it to figure out how to add new pitches to his quiver. During the break between the 2017 and 2018 seasons, Bauer was able to scientifically develop a slider he never had before.

This flow creates a low-pressure zone on the left side, and the ball moves towards the area of vacuum, says Bauer. That force—the Magnus force—creates the bending effect. Pitches like a breaking ball take full advantage of the Magnus force to arc the baseball’s path as it travels towards the batter.</p></div></section></div><div class="margin_vertical"><section class="content"><div><p class="paragraph | margin_bottom_lg margin_centered">Not all pitches are trying to bend so dramatically, though.

A breaking ball appears to come in level with the top of the strike zone (roughly the middle of the batter’s abdomen) and drops down to a batter’s knees as it crosses the plate. “There are some very neat illusions that are associated with a breaking ball,” says Goff. “It will look like it’s just straight on a string and at the very last second it drops.”</p></div></section></div><div class="margin_vertical"><section class="content"><div><p class="paragraph | margin_bottom_lg margin_centered">Gravity is the key here. “Three quarters of the ball’s drop happens in that last half of the flight to the plate,” Goff says. A pitcher can put topspin on a ball by letting their fingers sit down the front of the ball, and that topspin adds to gravity and enhances the drop of the pitch.</p><div class=""><div class="container_column flex arcAdsBox           margin_bottom_lg           middle1073 invisible"><div class="container_row flex justify_center"><div class="align_items_center container_column flex"><span class="article_ad_text | color_gray">ADVERTISEMENT<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200220180655/https://www.bonniercorp.com/popular-science/" class="ad_link"> / ADVERTISE WITH US</a></span><div id="InlineArticleBodyAd993" class="arcad ad-middle1073"></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div><div class="margin_vertical"><section class="content"><div><p class="paragraph | margin_bottom_lg margin_centered">Sometimes, though, it can be a lack of flow that makes a pitch valuable.</p></div></section></div><div class="margin_vertical"><section class="content"><div><p class="paragraph | margin_bottom_lg margin_centered">Airflow across the baseball can move in smooth sheets called laminar flow, or turbulent pockets.

This lack of spin removes the Magnus force from effect, and leaves the combination of laminar and turbulent flow as the seams of the baseball catch the air. This creates a pitch that bobs and weaves as small changes cause turbulent flow in different places around the ball, pulling it through the air unpredictably.</p><div class=""><div class="container_column flex arcAdsBox           margin_bottom_lg           middle1074 invisible"><div class="container_row flex justify_center"><div class="align_items_center container_column flex"><span class="article_ad_text | color_gray">ADVERTISEMENT<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200220180655/https://www.bonniercorp.com/popular-science/" class="ad_link"> / ADVERTISE WITH US</a></span><div id="InlineArticleBodyAd994" class="arcad ad-middle1074"></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div><div class="margin_vertical"><section class="content"><div><p class="paragraph | margin_bottom_lg margin_centered">“The erratic movement on a knuckleball is an example of what physicists call a chaotic function,” Nathan says. “A small little change in those release conditions could make a really big change in what happens to the ball.” Accidentally putting spin on one creates a big slow pitch for a hitter. Throwing one is like squeezing a watermelon seed out of your fingers in an attempt to put as little spin on the ball as possible, says Goff.</p></div></section></div><div class="margin_vertical"><section class="content"><div><p class="paragraph | margin_bottom_lg margin_centered">By creating pockets of turbulent air in one place on the ball, you can add more movement to a ball that’s already using the Magnus force, Bauer says. When the locations of the seams create a non-uniform rough patch on the ball, the turbulent air pulls the ball in that direction. “The rough spot is like a flat tire on a car,” says Bauer. “The right side gets more turbulence and the ball will turn towards the right.” You can see this in action in Bauer’s sinker, which uses the combination to drop and cut right due to the placement of the seams.</p></div></section></div><div class="margin_vertical"><section class="content"><div><p class="paragraph | margin_bottom_lg margin_centered">Using an understanding of Magnus force and the impact of air flow, in the 2018 offseason Bauer decided he could add a slider to his repertoire that had no vertical movement due to spin (just gravity), with seven to ten inches of horizontal movement.  A slider is typically in between a fastball and a curveball in both speed and amount of motion. “It’s hard to talk about pitch classifications anymore because they get lumped into these categories that don’t actually have much meaning,” Bauer says. “Now you can quantify how a pitch is thrown actually moves and pitch classification has become somewhat meaningless because it depends on what the person himself calls it.” However you define the slider, Bauer looked at his arsenal and decided it would be more dangerous with a pitch with precisely this movement.</p></div></section></div><div class="margin_vertical"><section class="content"><div><p class="paragraph | margin_bottom_lg margin_centered">He started by studying the gyroscopic spin of a football, which has no horizontal or vertical movement. “I needed to have a pitch that was perfectly gyroscopic but the axis was tilted up towards vertical as much as possible,” Bauer says. “The more I could tilt that axis up, the more lateral movement I was going to get.” More tilt means more Magnus force to push the ball sideways. Using pushpins to identify the axis of rotation, Bauer and his dad spent six hours working through how Bauer would hold the ball to get laminar flow across the ball that would add to the sideways movement of the Magnus force.</p></div></section></div><div class="padding_vertical embed"><section class="content"></section></div><div class="margin_vertical"><section class="content"><div><p class="paragraph | margin_bottom_lg margin_centered">Once he had a grip, Bauer looked to video and images of other pitchers with a similar pitch, like <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200220180655/https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/strasst01.shtml">Stephen Strasburg</a> of the Washington Nationals and <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200220180655/https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/stromma01.shtml">Marcus Stroman</a> of the Toronto Blue Jays. "It turns out that the grips we had designed, completely blind, just based on physics and an understanding of the principles, turned out to be the exact grip that Strasburg and Stroman use," Bauer says.

There is about a tenth of a second after the ball is released before a batter has to decide to swing, he says. “By changing the speed of the pitches, the batter’s timing is messed up,” Goff says. “Changing the location of the pitches, the batter starts to guess.” The more variety, the more swinging strikes a pitcher gets, which is what Bauer was hoping he could get with his slider.</p></div></section></div><div class="margin_vertical"><section class="content"><div><p class="paragraph | margin_bottom_lg margin_centered">For the first month of the season Bauer fought to get the slider back, while pitching his other mix in games.

Now his slider consistently has seven to ten inches of horizontal movement.</p></div></section></div><div class="margin_vertical"><section class="content"><div><p class="paragraph | margin_bottom_lg margin_centered">“That’s the power of understanding the principles and what’s actually going on at that critical moment,” Bauer says. “Because I understand and did all the studying and designing of it, it makes it very easy to make adjustments because you know all the different control parameters.”</p></div></section></div><div class="margin_vertical"><section class="content"><div><p class="paragraph | margin_bottom_lg margin_centered">Bauer is unusual in Major League Baseball for knowing the physics behind his pitches, Nathan says. Most players don’t think about it. Bauer thinks there’s a good reason for that; Analyzing the physics of the game makes it harder to perform if you don’t know how to switch back into a performance mindset. He says he’s lucky that he had enough time in the minors to figure out how to do that, but most players aren’t given that luxury.

This flow creates a low-pressure zone on the left side, and the ball moves towards the area of vacuum, says Bauer. That force—the Magnus force—creates the bending effect.

A breaking ball appears to come in level with the top of the strike zone (roughly the middle of the batter’s abdomen) and drops down to a batter’s knees as it crosses the plate. “There are some very neat illusions that are associated with a breaking ball,” says Goff. “It will look like it’s just straight on a string and at the very last second it drops.”"},{"_id":"55JXKQ7CUBF4XMQZKT35R2WJ4I","type":"text","content":"Gravity is the key here. “Three quarters of the ball’s drop happens in that last half of the flight to the plate,” Goff says. A pitcher can put topspin on a ball by letting their fingers sit down the front of the ball, and that topspin adds to gravity and enhances the drop of the pitch."},{"_id":"CR66OW4Z2VD7HGHTPRTSTILLFU","type":"text","content":"Sometimes, though, it can be a lack of flow that makes a pitch valuable."},{"_id":"B2COKIOS6BCGTAK6ZM732UFRMI","type":"text","content":"Airflow across the baseball can move in smooth sheets called laminar flow, or turbulent pockets.

This lack of spin removes the Magnus force from effect, and leaves the combination of laminar and turbulent flow as the seams of the baseball catch the air. This creates a pitch that bobs and weaves as small changes cause turbulent flow in different places around the ball, pulling it through the air unpredictably."},{"_id":"U67AAIJ5ZRGYZD3FJ66O3RWLWI","type":"text","content":"“The erratic movement on a knuckleball is an example of what physicists call a chaotic function,” Nathan says. “A small little change in those release conditions could make a really big change in what happens to the ball.” Accidentally putting spin on one creates a big slow pitch for a hitter. Throwing one is like squeezing a watermelon seed out of your fingers in an attempt to put as little spin on the ball as possible, says Goff."},{"_id":"JR3DOHV5M5BHVPNWR44UQ2YOHY","type":"text","content":"By creating pockets of turbulent air in one place on the ball, you can add more movement to a ball that’s already using the Magnus force, Bauer says. When the locations of the seams create a non-uniform rough patch on the ball, the turbulent air pulls the ball in that direction. “The rough spot is like a flat tire on a car,” says Bauer. “The right side gets more turbulence and the ball will turn towards the right.” You can see this in action in Bauer’s sinker, which uses the combination to drop and cut right due to the placement of the seams."},{"_id":"C7DXJ2JGKFAL7PVRRC7Z2J4EPY","type":"text","content":"Using an understanding of Magnus force and the impact of air flow, in the 2018 offseason Bauer decided he could add a slider to his repertoire that had no vertical movement due to spin (just gravity), with seven to ten inches of horizontal movement.  A slider is typically in between a fastball and a curveball in both speed and amount of motion. “It’s hard to talk about pitch classifications anymore because they get lumped into these categories that don’t actually have much meaning,” Bauer says. “Now you can quantify how a pitch is thrown actually moves and pitch classification has become somewhat meaningless because it depends on what the person himself calls it.” However you define the slider, Bauer looked at his arsenal and decided it would be more dangerous with a pitch with precisely this movement."},{"_id":"OUOZYE3SQ5BBXBIZTXY3QZY54A","type":"text","content":"He started by studying the gyroscopic spin of a football, which has no horizontal or vertical movement. “I needed to have a pitch that was perfectly gyroscopic but the axis was tilted up towards vertical as much as possible,” Bauer says. “The more I could tilt that axis up, the more lateral movement I was going to get.” More tilt means more Magnus force to push the ball sideways. Using pushpins to identify the axis of rotation, Bauer and his dad spent six hours working through how Bauer would hold the ball to get laminar flow across the ball that would add to the sideways movement of the Magnus force."},{"_id":"EFBIM7PDUBG67OEGY75H3FNPME","type":"raw_html","content":"<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Get you some spin axis and fluid dynamics in your life <a href=\"https://t.co/fq8FqFkd9w\">pic.twitter.com/fq8FqFkd9w</a></p>&mdash; Trevor Bauer (@BauerOutage) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BauerOutage/status/919361789724258304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 15, 2017</a></blockquote>\r\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\r\n"},{"_id":"QOIDQV5ABZDPXBWKBYA2PDXIJM","type":"text","content":"Once he had a grip, Bauer looked to video and images of other pitchers with a similar pitch, like <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/strasst01.shtml\">Stephen Strasburg</a> of the Washington Nationals and <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/stromma01.shtml\">Marcus Stroman</a> of the Toronto Blue Jays. \"It turns out that the grips we had designed, completely blind, just based on physics and an understanding of the principles, turned out to be the exact grip that Strasburg and Stroman use,\" Bauer says. \"It's just, it took my dad and I six hours to develop that grip instead of perhaps 20 years of experimentation and fiddling.\""},{"_id":"54DALBSEUZC43MLUU3F2LXOPAQ","type":"text","content":"It took another six hours of throwing and fiddling with the grip for Bauer to throw the slider he wanted, along with a changeup he designed in a similar way. “But then I had proof that I could actually do that, out of my arm and out of my delivery,” Bauer says.
