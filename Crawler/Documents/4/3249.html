In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as "may," "might," "will," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential" or "continue," and the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. Such forward-looking statements which are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us, may include, but are not limited to, projections of our future financial performance based on our growth strategies and anticipated trends in our business and industry, statements concerning ICE&#8217;s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements are only predictions based on ICE&#8217;s current expectations about future events. They involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause ICE&#8217;s results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: ICE&#8217;s ability to implement its strategic initiatives, economic, political and market conditions and fluctuations, government and industry regulation, interest rate risk and U.S. and global competition, and other factors detailed in ICE&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These risks and uncertainties are not exhaustive and forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to change. We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all risks and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact that these factors will have on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. The inclusion of such projections in any report should not be regarded as a representation by ICE that the projections will prove to be correct. Neither ICE nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We are under no duty to update any of these forward-looking statements after the date of any report to conform our prior statements to actual results or revised expectations and we do not intend to do so.</p><h2 class="secondary-header">Proprietary Rights</h2><p class="">All right, title and interest in this Website, including but not limited to the text, content, all compilations of real time or other information, including all pricing and market data, any software programs, tools, applications and/or code available on or through this Website and accompanying links, photographs, images, video, audio and graphics contained on this Website, the selection and arrangement of the aforementioned and the &#8220;look and feel&#8221; of this Website, are owned, licensed or controlled by ICE, its applicable affiliate, its licensors or the relevant third party (&#8220;Third Party Provider&#8221;) credited as the owner or lawful provider of the content.

Such forward-looking statements which are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us, may include, but are not limited to, projections of our future financial performance based on our growth strategies and anticipated trends in our business and industry, statements concerning ICE&#8217;s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements are only predictions based on ICE&#8217;s current expectations about future events. They involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause ICE&#8217;s results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: ICE&#8217;s ability to implement its strategic initiatives, economic, political and market conditions and fluctuations, government and industry regulation, interest rate risk and U.S. and global competition, and other factors detailed in ICE&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These risks and uncertainties are not exhaustive and forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to change. We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all risks and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact that these factors will have on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. The inclusion of such projections in any report should not be regarded as a representation by ICE that the projections will prove to be correct. Neither ICE nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We are under no duty to update any of these forward-looking statements after the date of any report to conform our prior statements to actual results or revised expectations and we do not intend to do so.","className":""},{"type":"header","content":"Proprietary Rights","className":"secondary-header"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"All right, title and interest in this Website, including but not limited to the text, content, all compilations of real time or other information, including all pricing and market data, any software programs, tools, applications and/or code available on or through this Website and accompanying links, photographs, images, video, audio and graphics contained on this Website, the selection and arrangement of the aforementioned and the &#8220;look and feel&#8221; of this Website, are owned, licensed or controlled by ICE, its applicable affiliate, its licensors or the relevant third party (&#8220;Third Party Provider&#8221;) credited as the owner or lawful provider of the content.
