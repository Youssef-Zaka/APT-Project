            "transcript" : "The Harlem Renaissance was a period of blossoming African American culture and creative arts based in the Black neighborhood of Harlem in New York City.\rIts most famous participants include writers and thinkers like W.E.B. Du Bois, Langston Hughes, and Alain Locke\u2014\rbut it wasn\u2019t only male creatives who flourished.\rHere are just a few women writers of the Harlem Renaissance:\r\rNella Larsen\u2019s two novels, Quicksand and Passing, both grapple with sexuality, societal expectation, and colorism. In 1930, Larsen became the first Black woman to be awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship.\r\rOne of few Harlem Renaissance writers to never live in New York City, poet Anne Spencer connected with other writers by opening her Virginia home as a safe space for Black travellers. She published 30 poems in her lifetime and, in 1973, became the first Black woman to have poetry featured in the Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry. \r\rAlice Dunbar Nelson was a major voice in Black literature since the publication of her first book in 1895. Beginning in the 1920s, her prolific reviews of other Harlem Renaissance writers and artists\u2019 work earned her nationwide recognition.\r\rThe first Black student to join the Drama and Literary societies at her Brooklyn, New York, high school, Gwendolyn Bennett was an early entrant into Harlem Renaissance society. Bennett was a professor, editor, and a prolific poet whose writing appeared in nearly all the prominent Black publications of her time.\r\rIn the 1970s, novelist Alice Walker reintroduced Americans to the work of Zora Neale Hurston, a significant novelist of the Harlem Renaissance. Walker found and identified Hurston\u2019s previously unmarked grave, lauded her work in The New York Times, and gave the literary world a much-needed reminder: Zora Neale Hurston likely wasn\u2019t the only genius Black woman they had left behind.",

In different areas of Earth, one might find sweltering deserts, dense tropical rainforests, or bone-chilling tundras. Each biome and habitat comes with its own selection of flora and fauna, and it may include physical features such as canyons, volcanoes, rivers, or caves. Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest. Shifting trends in human migration have resulted in a human geography that is profoundly different from that of centuries ago.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg","altText":"Geography & Travel","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg"}},{"id":3000,"title":"Health & Medicine","urlTitle":"Health-Medicine","description":"The study of the human mind and body, how these function, and how they interact‚Äînot only with each other but also with their environment‚Äîhas been of utmost importance in ensuring human well-being.

The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale. It has led to large-scale social movements and reforms concerning issues such as suffrage, slavery, women's rights, racism, environmentalism, gay rights, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/11/195611-131-4DFC1336/Belgian-pride-parade-People-streets-flags-Brussels-2017.jpg","altText":"Lifestyles & Social Issues","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/11/195611-131-4DFC1336/Belgian-pride-parade-People-streets-flags-Brussels-2017.jpg"}},{"id":12000,"title":"Literature","urlTitle":"Literature","description":"With the development of language, the human imagination has found a way to create and communicate through the written word.

The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens.

For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next?

					The Harlem Renaissance was a period of blossoming African American culture and creative arts based in the Black neighborhood of Harlem in New York City.Its most famous participants include writers and thinkers like W.E.B. Du Bois, Langston Hughes, and Alain Locke‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt only male creatives who flourished.Here are just a few women writers of the Harlem Renaissance:Nella Larsen‚Äôs two novels, Quicksand and Passing, both grapple with sexuality, societal expectation, and colorism. In 1930, Larsen became the first Black woman to be awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship.One of few Harlem Renaissance writers to never live in New York City, poet Anne Spencer connected with other writers by opening her Virginia home as a safe space for Black travellers. She published 30 poems in her lifetime and, in 1973, became the first Black woman to have poetry featured in the Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry. Alice Dunbar Nelson was a major voice in Black literature since the publication of her first book in 1895. Beginning in the 1920s, her prolific reviews of other Harlem Renaissance writers and artists‚Äô work earned her nationwide recognition.The first Black student to join the Drama and Literary societies at her Brooklyn, New York, high school, Gwendolyn Bennett was an early entrant into Harlem Renaissance society. Bennett was a professor, editor, and a prolific poet whose writing appeared in nearly all the prominent Black publications of her time.In the 1970s, novelist Alice Walker reintroduced Americans to the work of Zora Neale Hurston, a significant novelist of the Harlem Renaissance. Walker found and identified Hurston‚Äôs previously unmarked grave, lauded her work in The New York Times, and gave the literary world a much-needed reminder: Zora Neale Hurston likely wasn‚Äôt the only genius Black woman they had left behind.</div>
