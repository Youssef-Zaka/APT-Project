			<h3>Usage Reports</h3>

			<p>This<span class='glossarylink'> section <span class='glossarybox'>The first level of subdivision of a “Book” or “Reference Work”.</span></span>lists the COUNTER Usage Reports; it also specifies the content, format and delivery specifications that these reports must meet to be designated ‘COUNTER-Compliant’. For each compliant product vendors must supply the relevant COUNTER-compliant usage reports at no additional charge to customers.</p>
<p>Customers may specify the start and end month of data to be reported in the COUNTER Reports. To enable customers to do this, vendors must have a pool of at least 24 months of usage data available, and a COUNTER Report must be capable of displaying at least 12 months of usage data, if this is requested by the customer. If no start or end month is specified by a customer, the default<span class='glossarylink'> reporting period <span class='glossarybox'>The total time period covered in a usage report.</span></span>is the Current Calendar Year-to-Date. (Newly COUNTER-compliant vendors may not have 24 months of COUNTER compliant usage data available, in which case they must make available as many months’ usage data as they have until they have 24 months of usage data)</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Usage Reports categorised as <strong>Standard</strong> in Table 1 above are those reports that vendors must provide (depending on the types of content covered) in order to be COUNTER compliant. <strong>Optional</strong> reports are not required for COUNTER-compliance, but are designed to enable more detailed usage reporting, where vendors have the capability to do this.</p>
<h4 id="exampleusage">4.1 Example usage reports</h4>
<p>Examples are provided below of the COUNTER usage reports, in separate sections for Journals, Databases, Books and Reference Works, and for<span class='glossarylink'> Multimedia <span class='glossarybox'>Non-textual media such as images, audio and video.</span></span>content. While these examples are in Excel format, (See<span class='glossarylink'> Section <span class='glossarybox'>The first level of subdivision of a “Book” or “Reference Work”.</span></span>4.3 below for other report delivery options), primarily for visualisation purposes, all COUNTER usage reports must be available in XML, irrespective of other formats provided. Reports must comply exactly with the formats specified in order to be COUNTER compliant.</p>
<p>In all the usage reports listed below the<span class='glossarylink'> Reporting Period <span class='glossarybox'>The total time period covered in a usage report.</span></span>Total column has been moved from the column at right-hand side of the report, which it occupied in previous Releases, to a column on the left-hand side of the monthly data columns. This move has been made to ensure that the<span class='glossarylink'> Reporting Period <span class='glossarybox'>The total time period covered in a usage report.</span></span>Total column is at a fixed place in each report, irrespective of the number of months of data being reported. This facilitates the automated harvesting and processing of the usage reports.</p>
<p>The majority of the Excel examples provided below show usage data for the months of January, February and March. This limited range of months has been selected simply to allow the reports to be displayed clearly on the page within this document. In reality the usage reports will show columns for every month during the Reporting Period, to the end month selected. Where the end month selected is in the future, the relevant columns should be shown with no data in the cells</p>

</ol>
<h4 id="datadisplayrules">Data Display Rules</h4>
<p>Vendors must adhere to the Data Display Rules specified below. While these rules apply specifically to Journal Report 1, they also illustrate the rules that should be followed for the other reports listed in this Code of Practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="background-color: #e5fcff;">
<h4 id="journalreport1displayrules">Journal Report 1: Display Rules</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Notes:</span><br />
Background cell colour is optional for all cells. No cell should contain commas or tab characters.</p>
<p>These rules apply to both Excel and TSV (Tab-Separated Value) formats of JR1. The notation used refers to cells using standard Excel notation, with cell “B6” meaning the cell in the second column and at the 6th row. In TSV, this would refer to the 2nd field position on the 6th row of the file.</p>
<p>There must be a column for every month that falls within the<span class='glossarylink'> Reporting Period <span class='glossarybox'>The total time period covered in a usage report.</span></span>covered by the report. Where recorded usage is zero in a given month ‘0’ must be included in the relevant cells. Where usage has not yet been recorded for a given month the relevant cells must be left blank.</p>

		<h3>How to become Counter Compliant</h3>
<p>All academic libraries across the world use and trust COUNTER usage reports to inform renewal and new purchasing decisions, to inform faculty about the value of the library and its resources and to understand user behaviour and improve the user experience.</p>
<p>Counter will help publishers and vendors to become compliant. The <a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Friendly_Guide_Providers_20170706-1.pdf">The Friendly Guide for Providers Release 5</a>  and <a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Tech_Notes_20170710.pdf">Technical Notes</a> and will provide the information you will need to start the process. Content providers transitioning from Release 4 to Release 5 compliance will also find <a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/transition-timeline-005.pdf">transition timeline</a> useful in their planning.</p>
<h3>Audit Process</h3>
<p>To comply with the Code of Practice, publishers and vendors must be independently audited within six months of signing the <a href="https://www.projectcounter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/APPB.pdf">Declaration of COUNTER Compliance</a>, and annually thereafter.</p>
<p>There are three approved COUNTER auditors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.abc.org.uk">ABC</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.bpaww.com">BPA Worldwide</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.dekra-certification.com">Dekra Certification</a></li>
</ul>
<p>COUNTER will also accept an audit by any Chartered Accountant (UK), CPA (USA) or their equivalent elsewhere.</p>
