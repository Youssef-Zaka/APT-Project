<dl><dt>ARTICLE 24</dt></dl>
<p>§1 - The General Assembly meets by decision of the Board of Directors whenever the purpose of the association requires it.
</p><p>§2 - The power of decision to organise the General Assembly is reserved to the Board of Directors, its power of execution is delegated to a person designated by the Board of Directors.
</p><p>§3 - It must be convened at least once a year for the approval of the annual accounts of the previous financial year, the discharge of the directors and the auditors and the approval of the budget for the following year.
</p>
<dl><dt>ARTICLE 25</dt></dl>
<p>The Annual General Meeting is held within six months of the end of the financial year.
</p>
<dl><dt>ARTICLE 26</dt></dl>
<p>The Board of Directors is also obliged to convene the General Meeting if 1/5th of the effective members submit a request to that effect to the Board of Directors indicating the items on the agenda to be discussed. The board of directors must provide for the convening of the general meeting within 21 days of the request, which must be organised no later than the 40th day after the request.
</p>
<dl><dt>ARTICLE 27</dt></dl>
<p>§1 - In order to be valid, invitations to the general meeting must be signed and sent by a person designated by the board of directors. All effective members, including the directors and the auditors, must be convened by e-mail, ordinary letter or registered letter at least fifteen days before the meeting. The notice of meeting shall be published electronically in an obvious place such as the official website of the association.
</p><p>§2 - All persons whose personal files are to be dealt with at the hearing must be invited by electronic mail or by registered letter at least fifteen days before the hearing. If their file concerns disciplinary matters, the invitation must clearly indicate the scheduled session, the charges, the place where the file can be consulted and the period of consultation.
</p>
<dl><dt>ARTICLE 29</dt></dl>
<p>Except in cases where the law or the articles of association provide for a special majority, decisions shall be taken by a majority of the votes of the members present or represented, irrespective of the number of members present and represented, and abstentions and invalid votes shall not be taken into account in the assessment. In the event of a tie, the proposal shall be rejected.
</p>
<dl><dt>ARTICLE 30</dt></dl>
<p>§1 - The amendment of the articles can only be decided upon if this amendment is mentioned in detail in the agenda and if two thirds of the effective members are present or represented. If this number is not reached, a second meeting may be convened, at which a valid decision may be taken, regardless of the number of participants. This second meeting may not take place within 15 days of the first meeting. A majority of 2/3 of the votes present or represented is also required for any amendment to the statutes, also at the second general meeting.
</p><p>§2 - The modification of the object or purpose of the association can only be decided by a majority of 4/5ths of the votes when abstentions and invalid votes have no value.
</p>
<dl><dt>ARTICLE 31</dt></dl>
<p>§1 - Except in the case of judicial dissolution or dissolution by operation of law, the General Assembly may only decide to dissolve the association if 2/3 of the members are present or represented at the General Assembly and a majority of 4/5 agrees to dissolve the association voluntarily. The proposal for the voluntary dissolution of the association must be explicitly mentioned in the agenda of the general meeting.
</p><p>§2 - If 2/3 of the members are not present or represented at this General Assembly, a second General Assembly must be convened which will deliberate validly regardless of the number of members present or represented provided that a majority of 4/5ths accepts the voluntary dissolution of the association. Abstentions and invalid votes have no value.
</p><p>§3 - In the event of voluntary dissolution, the General Assembly or, failing this, the court, shall appoint one or more liquidators. It also determines their powers and the conditions of liquidation.
</p><p>§4 - The assets, after discharge of the liabilities, are transferred to an association with a similar object, designated by the general meeting.
</p>
<dl><dt>ARTICLE 32</dt></dl>
<p>§1 - The general meeting may only decide to temporarily or permanently exclude an effective member, a member of the board of directors or an affiliated member if at least two thirds of the members are present or represented at the meeting. If the latter condition is not fulfilled, a second meeting is necessary and the new meeting shall deliberate and take a valid decision, regardless of the number of members present or represented. The second meeting may not take place within fifteen days of the first meeting. An exclusion shall only be adopted if it obtains two thirds of the votes cast, abstentions not being counted in the numerator or denominator.
</p><p>§2 - In the event of the exclusion of a director or an effective or affiliated member, this item must be explicitly included on the agenda and the person in question must be invited to present his or her defence.
</p>
<dl><dt>ARTICLE 33</dt></dl>
<p>§1 - The General Meeting decides on disciplinary measures by a simple majority of votes.
</p><p>§2 - If effective or affiliated members, or directors of the association (or legal entities of which they are shareholders, directors or employees) provide goods or services against payment or win tenders, the general meeting shall be informed of the content of the contract and the manner in which it has arisen, as well as the financial implications of the contract and whether a member, associate member or director would personally benefit from it and, if so, which ones.
</p><p>§3 - If the general meeting has not been informed, the presumption of a conflict of interest will be justified and the effective member or affiliate member or director concerned will be subject to disciplinary sanctions, as well as any third party director who has approved such an agreement, and the burden of proof will be lightened. Conversely, this means that the persons concerned must demonstrate that there has been no personal gain for the parties concerned. In this context, personal gain is to be considered as excessive profits, commissions or variable remuneration above that which would be received for other similar contracts or supplies.
</p><p>§4 - Where a personal gain is established, the general meeting may take the following measures, with the possibility of invoking mitigating circumstances, if it can be shown that the association obtained a material or financial benefit from the transaction and that the benefit was insignificant:
</p>
<ol><li>attempts to conceal personal gain or adverse consequences for the association are an aggravating circumstance ;</li>
<li>against an affiliated member, the general assembly may decide to impose a sanction ranging from a reprimand to temporary or at most permanent exclusion ;</li>
<li>in the case of an effective member, the general meeting may decide on a sanction ranging from a reprimand to temporary or at most permanent exclusion as an effective member and as an affiliated member;</li>
<li>in the case of a director, the general meeting will decide on a sanction ranging from a reprimand to dismissal as a director (the general meeting must indicate whether or not she is authorised to represent herself) or temporary or permanent exclusion as an effective member or affiliate member;</li>
<li>in any case, reimbursement of the amount of the illegal personal gain may be demanded.</li></ol>
<p>§5 - Pending a decision by the General Assembly, the Board of Directors may suspend effective and affiliated members who have committed a serious breach of the association's statutes or of the rules of honour and decency, which prevents them from participating in the association's activities.
</p>
<dl><dt>ARTICLE 34</dt></dl>
<p>Minutes shall be taken of each meeting, which shall be signed by the chairman of the meeting and by the directors who so request. The minutes shall be recorded in a register, which may be consulted by members and interested third parties at the registered office of the association. Extracts from these documents are validly signed by the directors who may represent the association.
