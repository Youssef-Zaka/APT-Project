TO MAKE THESE TERMS OF SERVICE EASIER TO READ, THE FOREGOING REFERENCED WEB SITES AND ANY MOBILE APPS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE “WEB SITES” AND THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY US THROUGH THE WEB SITES ARE REFERRED TO AS THE “SERVICES.” YOUR USE OF THE WEB SITES OR THE SERVICES IS SUBJECT TO YOUR AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, WHICH WILL BECOME A BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND US (THE &quot;AGREEMENT&quot;).</p><p>The Services are available only to persons who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Services are not available to individuals under the age of 13. If you are under 13, then you are not permitted to use the Services. In order to receive the Services, you must pay in advance the applicable fee unless we agree that you may make payment pursuant to another payment plan. We may increase the fees for Services at any time. In certain cases, you must complete a sign-up form in order to use the Services. You will have one Account (as defined below) that is used for Services offered through our Web Sites. We reserve the right to refuse registration of, or cancel, Accounts at any time and for any reason, as we deem appropriate. Upon termination of your registration as a &quot;user&quot;, you will no longer be allowed access to the Services or your Account.

If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or we have reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we have the right to immediately terminate your access to the Web Sites (or any portion thereof) or Services.
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Account and password, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or Account, and for any other actions taken in connection with the Account or password. You agree to (a) immediately notify us of any known or suspected unauthorized use(s) of your password or Account, or any known or suspected breach of security, including loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password or credit card information; and (b) ensure that you exit from your Account at the end of each session.

We may increase the fees for Services at any time. In certain cases, you must complete a sign-up form in order to use the Services. You will have one Account (as defined below) that is used for Services offered through our Web Sites. We reserve the right to refuse registration of, or cancel, Accounts at any time and for any reason, as we deem appropriate. Upon termination of your registration as a \"user\", you will no longer be allowed access to the Services or your Account.
