<h2>BABBAGE OBSERVE</h2>
<p>Near the northern pole of the moon there is a crater named for  Charles Babbage. When he died in 1871, however, few people knew who he  was. Only one carriage (the Duchess of Somerset's) followed in the  burial procession that took his remains to Kensal Green Cemetery. The  Royal Society printed no obituary, and the Times ridiculed him. The  parts of the Difference Engine that had seemed possible of completion  in 1830 gathered dust in the Museum of King's College.</p>
<p>In 1878 The Cayley committee told the government not to bother  constructing Babbage's Analytical Engine. By the 1880's Babbage was  known primarily for his reform of mathematics at Cambridge. In 1899 the  magazine Temple Bar reported that &quot;the present generation appears to  have forgotten Babbage and his calculating machine&quot;. In 1908, after  being preserved for 37 years in alcohol, Babbage's brain was dissected  by Sir Victor Horsley of the Royal Society. Horsley had to remind the  society that Babbage had been a &quot;very profound thinker&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Babbage was born in Devonshire in 1791</strong>. Like John von  Neumann, he was the son of a banker - Benjamin (Old Five Percent)  Babbage. He attended Trinity College, Cambridge, receiving his MA in  1817. As the inventor of the first universal digital computer, he can  indeed be considered a profound thinker. The use of Jacquard punch  cards, of chains and subassemblies, and ultimately the logical  structure of the modern computer - all come from Babbage.</p>
<p>Popularly, Babbage is a sort of Abner Doubleday of data  processing, a colorful fellow whose portrait hangs in the anteroom but  whose actual import is slight. He is thought about, if at all, as a  funny sort of distracted character with dirty collar. But Babbage was  much more than that. He was an amazing intelligence.</p>
<h2>THE PHILOSOPHER</h2>
<p><strong>Babbage was an aesthete, but not a typical Victorian one.</strong> He  found beauty in things: in stamped buttons, stomach pumps, railways and  tunnels, in man's mastery over nature.</p>
<p>A social man, he was obliged to attend the theater. While others  dozed at Mozart, Babbage grew restless. &quot;Somewhat fatigued with the  opera [Don Juan]&quot;, he writes in the autobiographical <u>Passages From the Life of a Philosopher</u>,  &quot;I went behind the scenes to look at the mechanism&quot;. There, a workman  offered to show him around. Deserted when his Cicerone answered a cue,  he met two actors dressed at &quot;devils with long forked tails&quot;. The  devils were to convey Juan, via trapdoor and stage elevator, to hell.</p>
<p>In his box at the German Opera some time later (again not  watching the stage), Babbage noticed &quot;in the cloister scene at  midnight&quot; that his companion's white bonnet had a pink tint. He thought  about &quot;producing colored lights for theatrical representation&quot;. In  order to have something on which to shine his experimental lights,  Babbage devised &quot;Alethes and Iris&quot;, a ballet in which 60 damsels in  white were to dance. In the final scene, a series of dioramas were to  represent Alethes' travels. One diorama would show animals &quot;whose  remains are contained in each successive layer of the earth. In the  lower portions, symptoms of increasing heat show themselves until the  centre is reached, which contains a liquid transparent sea, consisting  of some fluid at white heat, which, however, is filled up with little  infinitesimal eels, all of one sort, wriggling eternally&quot;.</p>
<p>Two fire engines stood ready for the &quot;experiment of the dance&quot;,  as Babbage termed the rehearsal. Dancers &quot;danced and attitudinized&quot;  while he shone colored lights on them. But the theater manager feared  fire, and the ballet was never publicly staged.</p>
<p>Babbage enjoyed fire. He once was baked in an oven at 265&deg;F for  &quot;five or six minutes without any great discomfort&quot;, and on another  occasion was lowered into Mt. Vesuvius to view molten lava. Did he  ponder Hell? He had considered becoming a cleric, but this was not an  unusual choice for the affluent graduate with little interest in  business or law. In 1837 he published his Ninth Bridgewater Treatise,  to reconcile his scientific beliefs with Christian dogma. Babbage  argued that miracles were not, as Hume write, violations of laws of  nature, but could exist in a mechanistic world. As Babbage could  program long series on his calculating machines, God could program  similar irregularities in nature.</p>
<p>Babbage investigated biblical miracles.  &quot;In the course of his analysis&quot;, wrote B. V. Bowden in <u>Faster than Thought</u> (Pitman, London, 1971), &quot;he made the assumption that the chance of a  man rising from the dead is one in 10^12&quot;. Miracles are not, as he  wrote in <u>Passages From the Life of a Philosopher</u>, &quot;the breach of established laws, but... indicate the existence of far higher laws&quot;.</p>
<h2>THE POLITICIAN</h2>
<p><strong>Of all his roles, Babbage was least successful at this one</strong>. He  had himself to blame: he was too impatient, too severe with criticism,  too crotchety. Bowden wrote that, in later life, Babbage &quot;was  frequently and almost notoriously incoherent when he spoke in public&quot;.  What ultimately kept him from building an Analytical Engine was not his  inability to finish a project, but his inadequacies as a political man,  as a persuader. His vision was not matched by his judgment, patience,  or sympathy.</p>
<p>Babbage was a confusing political figure. A liberal republican,  he was pro-aristocratic and strongly antisocialist. Friend to Dickens  and to the workman, he was a crony to the Midlands industrialist. The  son of a Tory banker, he supported the cooperative movement and was  twice an unsuccessful Whig candidate to Parliament. But his liberalism  waned during the 1840's; by 1865, he was a conservative utilitarian for  whom capitalism and democracy were incompatible.</p>
<p>In July of 1822, two days after Shelley drowned near La Spezia,  Babbage wrote a letter to the president of the Royal Society,  describing his plan for calculating and printing mathematical tables by  machine. By June of 1823 Babbage met with the Chancellor of the  Exchequer, who granted money and told Babbage to proceed with the  engine (which he did, starting work in July). But no minutes were made  of this initial meeting.</p>
<p>In August 1827, Babbage's 35-year-old wife, Georgiana, died.  Babbage traveled to the Continent. By the end of 1828 he returned to  England, the initial &pound;1,500 grant gone. Babbage was financing the  construction himself. And the exchequer could not recall promising  further funds.</p>
<p>Convincing the government to continue with two tons of brass,  hand-fitted steel and pewter clockwork was not easy. In 1829 a group of  Babbage's friends solicited the attention of the Duke of Wellington,  then Prime Minister. Wellington went to see a model of the engine, and  in December ordered a grant of &pound;3,000. Engineer Joseph Clement was  hired to construct the engine for the government, and to oversee the  fabrication of special tools.</p>
<p>By the end of 1830 Babbage wanted to move the engine's workshop  to his house on Dorset Street. A fireproof shop was built where  Babbage's stables had stood. A man of great ego, Clement refused to  move from his own workshop, and made, according to Babbage,  &quot;inordinately extravagant demands&quot;. Babbage would not advance Clement  further money, so Clement dismissed his crew, and work on the  Difference Engine ceased.</p>
<p>This did not seem to perturb Babbage. His initial scheme for the  Difference Engine called for six decimal places and a second-order  difference; now he began planning for 20 decimal places and a  sixth-order difference. &quot;His ambitious to build immediately the largest  Difference Engine that could ever be needed&quot;, wrote Bowden, &quot;probably  delayed the exploitation of his own ideas for a century&quot;.</p>
<p>With Clement and his tools gone, Babbage wanted to meet with  Prime Minister Lord Melbourne in 1834 to tell him of a new machine he  had conceived - the Analytical Engine, an improved device capable of  any mathematical operation. He contended it would cost more to finish  the original engine than to construct this new one. But the government  did not wish to fund a new engine until the old one was complete. &quot;He  was ill-judged enough&quot;, wrote the Reverend Richard Sheepshanks, a  secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society, &quot;to press the  consideration of this new machine upon the members of Government, who  were already sick of the old one&quot;. (Sheepshanks was Babbage's  archenemy. In 1854 he published a vituperative 100-page work, &quot;Letter  to the Board of Visitors of the Greenwich Royal Observatory, in Reply  to the Calumnies of Mr.Babbage&quot; at its meeting in June 1853, and in his  book entitled <u>The Exposition of 1851</u>.)</p>
<p>For the next eight years, Babbage continued to apply to the  government for a decision on whether to continue the suspended  Difference Engine or begin the Analytical Engine, seemingly unaware of  the social problems that preoccupied Britain's leaders during what  Macauley called the Hungry Forties. Although &pound;17,000 of public money  had been spent, and a similar amount by Babbage, the Prime Minister  avoided him. &quot;It is nonsense&quot;, wrote Sheepshanks, &quot;to talk of  consulting a Prime Minister about the kind of Calculating Machine that  he wants&quot;. Prime Minister Robert Peel recommended that Babbage's  machine be set to calculate the time at which it would be of use. &quot;I  would like a little previous consideration&quot;, wrote Peel, &quot;before I move  in a thin house of country gentlemen a large vote for the creation of a  wooden man to calculate tables from the formula x^2 + x + 41&quot;.</p>
<p>Finally, in November of 1842, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  having sought the opinion of Sir George Airy on the utility of the  machine, and having been told it was &quot;worthless&quot;, said he and Peel  regretted the necessity of abandoning the project. On the 11th of  November, Babbage finally met with Peel, and was told the bad news.</p>
<p>By 1851 Babbage had &quot;given up all expectation of constructing  the Analytic Engine&quot;, even though he was to try once more with Disraeli  the next year. He wrote in the vitriolic Exposition of 1851: &quot;Thus bad  names are coined by worse men to destroy honest people, as the madness  of innocent dogs arises from the cry of insanity raised by their  villainous pursuers&quot;.</p>
<p>Some believed Babbage had &quot;been rewarded for his time and labor  by grants from the public use&quot;, according to biographer Moseley Maboth (<u>Irascible Genius</u>, Hutchinson &amp; Co., London, 1964).  &quot;We got <em>nothing</em> for our &pound;17,000 but Mr. Babbage's grumblings&quot;, wrote Sheepshanks in his  &quot;Letter to the Board of Visitors of the Greenwich Royal Observatory&quot;.  &quot;We should at least have had a clever toy for our money&quot;.</p>
<p>Peel, however, declared in Parliament that Babbage &quot;had derived  no emolument whatsoever from the government&quot;. Offered a baronetcy in  recognition of his work, Babbage refused, demanding a life peerage  instead. It was never granted.</p>
<h2>THE MUSIC HATER</h2>
<p><strong>Lady Lovelace wrote that Babbage hated music.</strong> He tolerated its  more exquisite forms, but abhorred it as practiced on the street.  &quot;Those whose minds are entirely unoccupied&quot;, he wrote with some  seriousness in <u>Observations of Street Nuisances</u> in 1864,  &quot;receive [street music] with satisfaction, as filling up the vacuum of  time&quot;. He calculated that 25% of his working power had been destroyed  by street nuisances, many of them intentional. Letters to the <em>Times</em> and the eventual enforcement of &quot;Babbage's Act&quot;, which would squelch street nuisances, made him the target of ridicule.</p>
<p>The public tormented him with an unending parade of fiddlers,  Punch-and-Judys, stilt-walkers, fanatic psalmists, and tub-thumpers.  Some neighbors hired musicians to play outside his windows. Others  willfully annoyed him with worn-out or damaged wind instruments.  Placards were hung in local shops, abusing him. During one 80-day  period Babbage counted 165 nuisances. One brass band played for five  hours, with only a brief intermission. Another blew a penny tin whistle  out his window toward Babbage's garden for a half and hour daily, for  &quot;many months&quot;.</p>
<p>When Babbage went out, children followed and cursed him. Adults  followed, too, but at a distance. Over a hundred people once skulked  behind him before he could find a constable to disperse them. Dead cats  and other &quot;offensive materials&quot; were thrown at his house. Windows were  broken. A man told him, &quot;You deserve to have your house burnt up, and  yourself in it, and I will do it for you, you old villain&quot;. Even when  he was on his deathbed, the organ-grinders ground implacably away.</p>
<p>In Babbage's relation with &quot;the Mob&quot;, we see is curious na&iuml;vet&eacute;  in matters social. Though he was far above the rabble - &quot;not unknown&quot;  to the Duke of Wellington and Lord Ashley - he seemed unaware of it at  times. He expected the same civility from a drunken brothel-keeper as  he would from a gentleman. In 1860, the London of the multitudinous  poor was far from gentle. Yet, in his ingenuousness, he could fathom  neither bums nor bamboozlers. He would cross town to check the tale of  a mendicant, and frequently was surprised to encounter deceit.</p>
<p>Babbage once met a man who claimed not to have eaten for two  days. Babbage invited him to breakfast. The next morning he called  Babbage's house, claiming hard times. Eventually, the man hired on as a  steward on a small West Indian ship. &quot;A few evenings after the ship  had supposed to have sailed, he called at my house&quot;, wrote Babbage,  &quot;apparently much agitated and stated that, in raising the anchor, an  accident had happened, by which the captain's leg had been broken&quot;.  Babbage later tried to verify this tale, but found his steward &quot;had  been living riotously at some public-house in another quarter, and had  been continually drunk&quot;.</p>
<p>Babbage never understood that the growth and crowdedness of  London resulted from the industrial expansion he championed. By 1850  industry had taken over in Britain. &quot;Many years before, I had purchased  a house in a very quiet locality&quot;, he wrote in 1864. Then came a  hackney stand, and beer shops and coffeehouses, and people. The din  beneath his window, the German bands, the pickpockets, came with  industry. The railroad and factory brought crowds to London, and with  them came meanness and thievery.</p>
<h2>THE NEWTONIAN</h2>
<p>Like Newton, <strong>Babbage was Lucasian professor of mathematics at  Cambridge</strong>. He founded both the British Association's Statistical  Society and the Royal Astronomical Society. His Difference Engine  calculated by Newton's method of successive differences, and would even  accomplish &quot;operations of human intellect&quot; by motive power. Babbage  believed in a world where, once all things were dutifully quantified,  all things could be predicted. As such, he was a perfect Newtonian.</p>
<p>Nature, according to Question 31 of Newton's <u>Opticks</u> is  &quot;very consonant and conformable to herself&quot;. Newton's program was  official in Babbage's time. Science &quot;consisted in isolating some  central, specific act, and then using it as the basis for all further  deductions concerning given set of phenomena&quot;, writes Ilya Prigogine in <u>Order Out of Chaos</u> (Bantam, 1984). The Marquis Laplace, and avid  Newtonian and friend of Babbage, said that if a mind could know  everything about particle behavior, it could describe everything:  &quot;Nothing would be uncertain, and the future, as the past, could be  present to out eyes&quot;.</p>
<p>Babbage wanted to quantify everything. Fact and data intoxicated  him. He tried mathematically handicapping horse races (he was  unsuccessful, and Lady Lovelace was nearly disgraced by gambling  debts). Babbage's love of numbers was well known: in the mail he  received requests for statistics. He would preserve any fact, simply  because he thought &quot;the preservation of any <em>fact</em> might ultimately be useful&quot;.</p>
<p>He would stop to measure the heartbeat of a pig (to be listed in  his &quot;Table of Constants of the Class Mammalia&quot;), or to affix a  numerical value to the breath of a calf. In 1856 he proposed to the  Smithsonian Institution that an effort be made to produce &quot;Tables of  Constants of Nature and Art&quot;, which would &quot;contain all those facts  which can be expressed by numbers in the various sciences and arts&quot;.</p>
<p>Babbage delighted in the thought of having a daily account of  food consumed by zoo animals, or the &quot;proportion of sexes amongst our  poultry&quot;. He proposed tables to calibrate the amount of wood (elm or  oak) a man would saw in 10 hours, or how much an ox or camel could plow  or mow in a day.</p>
<p>Babbage's unflagging fascination with statistics occasionally  overwhelmed him, as is seen in the animation of his Smithsonian  proposal. &quot;If I should be successful&quot;, he write, &quot;... it will thus call  into action a permanent cause of advancement toward truth, continually  leading to the more accurate determination of established fact, and to  the discovery and measurement of new ones&quot;.</p>
<p>In Mechanics Magazine in 1857 Babbage published a &quot;Table of the  Relative Frequency of the Causes of Breaking of Plate Glass Windows&quot;  detailing 464 breakages, of which &quot;drunken men, women, or boys&quot; were  responsible for 14. Babbage thought the table would be &quot;of value in  many respects&quot;, and might &quot;induce others to furnish more extensive  collections of similar and related facts&quot;.</p>
<p>Babbage faced significant problems with mechanical techniques.  He had to invent the tools for his engine. His thought is so thoroughly  modern that we wonder why he did not pursue electromechanical methods  for his engines (especially after Faraday's 1831 discovery of  induction, and Babbage's own electrical experiments). It is easy to  forget how long ago Babbage worked.</p>
<p>Even under the best of circumstances, the limitations of  Newtonian physics might have prevented Babbage from completing any  Analytical Engine. He did not know the advances of Maxwell (and could  not know those of Boltmann, G&ouml;del, and Heisenberg). Though he knew  Fourier socially, Babbage did not seem to grasp the importance of his  1811 work on heat propagation. Nor did he seem to know of Joule's  efforts with heat and mechanical energy.</p>
<p>The reversibility of attraction is a basic tenet of Newtonian  mechanics. A body, or piece of information, may retrace its path and  return to where it started. In Babbage's design for the Analytical  Engine, the discrete functions of mill (in which &quot;all operations are  performed&quot;) and store (in which all numbers are originally placed, and,  once computed, are returned) rely on this supposition of reversibility.</p>
<p>In his 1824 essay on heat, Carnot formulated the first  quantitative expression of irreversibility, by showing that a heat  engine cannot convert all supplied heat energy into mechanical energy.  Part of it is converted to useful work, but most is expelled into a  low-temperature reservoir and is wasted.</p>
<p>From this came William Thomson's discovery of the Second Law of  Thermodynamics in 1852, and Rudolf Clausius' discovery of entropy in  1865. In ideal, reversible processes, entropy remains constant. But in  others, as Eddington showed with his &quot;arrow of time&quot;, entropy only  increases. That means information cannot be shuttled between mill and  store without leaking, like faulty sacks of flour. Babbage did not  consider this, and it was perhaps his greatest obstacle to building the  engine.</p>
<p>It is easy to forget that Babbage was essentially a child of the  Enlightenment, and that his epoch was much different from our own. He  resided in an era of wood and coal, and the later era of steel and oil  would not begin for perhaps a decade after his death.</p>
<h2>THE INDUSTRIALIST</h2>
<p>&quot;Faith in machinery&quot;, wrote Matthew Arnold in <u>Culture and Anarchy</u> in 1869, &quot;is our besetting danger&quot;. The Whiggery of the mid-Victorian  era optimistically endorsed the principle of progress. Britain changed  from the relatively pastoral society of 1820 to the brutishly  materialistic one of the 1840's and 1850's.</p>
<p><strong>Babbage shared his era's enthusiasm for industry.</strong>  His finest work, <u>On the Economy of Manufactures</u>,  was published in 1832. In it, with watch in hand, Babbage discovers  operational research, the scientific study of manufacturing processes.  It is a tour of the manufacturing processes of the period, from  needle-making to tanning. Babbage detailed how things both ornamental  and functional were made in mid-nineteenth century Britain. His  characteristically blunt analysis of the printing trade caused  publishers to refuse his books.</p>
<p>Babbage worked when industry was in a frenzy to improve and  expand. Increases in manufactories and population were viewed as  &quot;absolute goods in themselves&quot;, noted Matthew Arnold. In <u>Das Kapital</u>, Marx quoted from <u>Economy of Manufactures</u> on this rage to improve: &quot;Improvements succeeded each other so rapidly,  that machines which had never been finished were abandoned in the hands  of their makers, because new improvements had superseded their  utility&quot;.</p>
<p>Babbage disliked Plato, according to his friend Wilmot Buxton,  because of Plato's condemnation of Archytas, &quot;who had constructed  machines of extraordinary power on mathematical principles&quot;. Plato  thought such an application of geometry degraded a noble intellectual  exercise, &quot;reducing it to the low level of a craft fit only for  mechanics and artisans&quot;.</p>
<p>Babbage loved practical science, and was among the first to  apply higher mathematics to certain commercial and industrial problems.  He took no part in what Anthony Hyman (in his book, <u>Charles Babbage</u>, Princeton University Press, 1982) called the era's &quot;growing divorce between academic science and engineering practice&quot;.</p>
<p>Babbage had a forge built in his house on Devonshire Street, and  accomplished, with his draftsmen, pioneering work in precision  engineering. Because conventional mechanical drawing proved inadequate  for his engines, he had to develop his own abstract notation. He called  his work with mechanical notation &quot;one of the most important additions  I have made to human knowledge&quot;.</p>
<p>With the die-cast pewter gear wheels of his Difference Engine,  and with his design of lathes and tool-shapers, Babbage did much to  advance the British machine tool industry. Sir Joseph Whitworth,  foreman in Babbage's shop, was responsible for the introduction of the  first series of standard screw threads.</p>
<p>The expansion of the railways marked the grandest phase of the  industrial revolution. Railroads freed manufacturing from its  dependence on water transport, and opened new markets. When the first  public railroad, the Stockton &amp; Darlington, opened on Sept. 27,  1823, Babbage was 34. By 1841 there were over 1,300 miles of rail in  Britain and 13,500 miles by 1870.</p>
<p>J. D. Bernal wrote in <u>Science and Industry in the Nineteenth Century</u> (University of Indiana Press, 1970), that &quot;Babbage seems to have been  one of the few who interested themselves scientifically in its [the  railroad's] working&quot;. Babbage's life was intertwined with the railroad.  He invented a cow catcher in 1838, apparently the first in Britain. He  was present for opening ceremonies of George Stephenson's Manchester  &amp; Liverpool line in 1830. Of the cheering crowds at the initial  run, he wrote, &quot;I feared... the people madly attempting to stop by  their feeble arms the momentum of our enormous train&quot;.</p>
<p>Babbage's great formal association with railroads came in 1837  and 1838, when he conducted experiments for I. K. Brunel's Great  Western Railway, which ran from London to Bristol. Babbage argued for  the superiority of Brunel's wide gauge track. His research into the  safety and efficiency of the line was, according to Bernal, &quot;100 years  ahead of his time&quot;.</p>
<p>Babbage rode the rails like a river pilot road the Mississippi:  knowing every turn on the route, every crossing, every intersection.  &quot;My ear&quot;, he wrote, &quot;had become peculiarly sensitive to the distant  sound of an engine&quot;.</p>
<h2>THE MISANTHROPE</h2>
<p><strong>Babbage was known as a &quot;mathematical Timon&quot;.</strong> In his later years  he came to suffer from a mechanist's misanthropy, regarding men as  fools and grubby thieves. By 1861 he said he had never spent a happy  day in his life, and would gladly give up the rest of it if he could  live three days 500 years thence.</p>
<p>Laughed at by costermongers and viscounts, met with diffidence  by his lessers, the impatient Babbage grew angry, like the  cave-dwelling Timon, with a changing world. Nevertheless, as his friend  Lionel Tollemache wrote, &quot;there was something harmless and even kindly  in his misanthropy, for... he hated mankind rather than man, and his  aversion was lost in its own generality&quot;.</p>
<p>Like Shakespeare's Timon, Babbage would have made a fascinating  leader. (Sheepshanks, of course, disagreed: &quot;I don't know any  Government office or any other office for which he is fit, certainly  none which requires sense and good temper&quot;.)</p>
<p>What a delightful, if distracting, place it would be where Babbage was in charge.  Consider his plan in <u>Economy of Manufactures</u> for a &quot;simple contrivance of tin tubes for speaking through&quot;. (Babbage  calculated it would take 17 minutes for words spoken in London to reach  Liverpool.) Or his plan for sending messages &quot;enclosed in small  cylinders&quot;, along wires suspended from high pillars (he thought church  steeples could be used for this purpose.)</p>
<p>In Passages, Babbage relates how, as a youth, he nearly drowned while testing his contrivance for walking on water.  In <u>Conjectures on the Conditions of the Surface of the Moon</u>,  we find him describing his 1837 experiments cooking a &quot;very respectable  stew of meat and vegetables&quot; in blackened boxes (with window glass)  buried in the earth. Toward the end of his life we find him mulling the  prevention of bank note forgery and working in marine navigation we  realize that, with his harlequin curiosity about all things, with his  wonderfully human sense of wonder, <strong>Babbage </strong>escapes pathos and attains  greatness.</p><p>Now that you've gotten free know-how on this topic, try to grow your skills even faster with <a href="/web/20150715232708/http://www.techiwarehouse.com/online-video-training.php">online video training</a>.
