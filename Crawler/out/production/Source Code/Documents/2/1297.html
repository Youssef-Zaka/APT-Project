problems. Engineers research, invent and refine processes across a wide range of fields including medicine, transport, electronics, and much more. Most of what you see around you was designed by an engineer somewhere.</p>
<h2>Why study engineering?</h2>
<p>Engineering is a fascinating and ever-evolving subject. There are many specialities to choose from according to your interests, as well as a huge range of jobs available. As an engineer, you can make your mark on the world in a positive and enduring way.</p>
<h3>1. Employability</h3>
<p>During an engineering degree, you practise all the skills that will be vital both in the workplace and in everyday life. The logical thinking, objectivity and decision-making you will develop are key in engineering jobs, as well as being transferrable skills for other careers. Engineers make great managers and, as a result, engineering is the most common undergraduate degree among Fortune 500 CEOs. Some of the most famous of these include Tim Cook (Apple), Satya Nadella (Microsoft) and Mary Barra (General Motors).</p>
<h3>2. High salary potential</h3>
<p>Engineering is a stable and well-paid profession. <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/news/college-degrees-highest-salary-potential" data-new-window="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">9 of the top 10 highest paid degree subjects are engineering-related</a> and in 2017, graduates with an engineering degree achieved an average gross annual wage of £45,000 — nearly double that of graduates of English, linguistics, languages and media.* With specialist training and a few years’ experience, salaries can be even higher.</p>
<h3>3. International opportunities</h3>
<p>Engineers are needed in every country in the world. They design and implement solutions to everyday problems such as access to water and electricity, safe transport and medicine — things that are needed everywhere. This means you will have opportunities to travel and work in other countries, enjoying all the experiences that come with it.</p>
<h3>4. Improve the world</h3>
<p>As an engineer, you will contribute to society in a unique way, be helping to invent and develop infrastructure that improves people’s lives. From medical engineering to civil engineering, what you do at work will make an impact that you can be proud of. For example, engineers are heavily involved in designing and implementing renewable technologies that benefit the planet and they have recently played a vital role in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, inventing lab-free ‘PCR’ testing and manufacturing vaccines.</p>
<h3>5. Think creatively</h3>
<p>Engineering is an exciting subject because it combines scientific and mathematical knowledge with creative thinking. It teaches you to question the established ways of doing things and to come up with new ideas. In order to do this, you need creativity and an ability to look beyond what has been done before.</p>

There are two types of Masters degree. Taught Masters are similar in structure to an undergraduate degree but to a more advanced level, you will attend lectures and seminars, working towards your dissertation. A research Masters allows you to work on a topic independently and further your chosen field of study to produce a paper for publishing.

You will be expected to have autonomy over your learning and spend time researching ideas that you have not been specifically asked to. Along with this, you will gain the necessary skills for your personal development, like motivation, independence and time management. You will also build your confidence in sharing your ideas, meeting new people and presenting to a group, which are all helpful in your personal and professional life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eEarn more money\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA question you will ask when deciding your next step is: is a Masters degree worth it? Further study is not cheap, but it is an investment. Research has shown that people with a Masters degree earn more than those with a Bachelors degree: full-time employed, working-age postgraduates had a median salary of £42,000 compared with £34,000 for working-age undergraduates (Graduate labour market statistics 2019).

You may be considering continuing in academia and going on to study for a PhD. A doctorate will make you a leading expert in your field, and allow you to continue your research in highly specialised topics. A Masters degree is necessary to continue to this level as it develops your independent research skills and knowledge ready for the highest achievement in academia.

In 2020, 66% of UK students who studied a Masters were in “high-skilled employment”, which saw an increase from the previous year (UK Government’s graduate labour market statistics). By learning critical academic theory in the context of a subject you feel passionately about, you will gain a new perspective on your field of work, which will ultimately allow you to aim higher and achieve more in your professional life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eImprove your earning potential\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudying a Masters can also open up career progression opportunities, meaning you will have access to a higher pay bracket and more senior positions within your profession. This means that students with postgraduate qualifications are statistically likely to earn more than those with only one degree. The UK Government’s graduate labour market statistics from 2020 revealed that the average salary for students with a Masters degree is around £35,000 a year, which is nearly £10,000 more than the average for undergraduate-only employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eInvest in your future\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs previously mentioned, studying a postgraduate degree in the right area will teach you valuable skills that can boost your career. If you are wondering whether studying a Masters is worth it or not, it could be a good idea to consider your desired career path. Many job roles across different professional industries require specialised knowledge, especially for more senior positions. Career fields that postgraduate qualifications have the most hiring impact in are Business, Economics and Medicine and Dentistry (FindAMasters, 2021).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow can I study a Masters?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChoosing to study a Masters degree is an exciting decision, but you may be wondering what you will need to get there.

These degrees usually involve less contact hours (these include classroom lessons and time with a lecturer), meaning they require more dedicated independent study time than a Bachelors degree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat qualifications will I need to study a Masters?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are wondering what qualifications you’ll need to study a Masters, this is simple. Most postgraduate degrees ask for good secondary education qualifications and at least a 2:1 (or equivalent) Bachelors level degree. If you are thinking about studying in the UK, but English is not your first language, you will also need to take a recognised English language qualification test, such as the International English Language Testing System (IELTS).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eCan you do a PhD without a Masters?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is worth considering that if you are interested in studying a PhD in the future, you will likely need a relevant Masters qualification in your chosen area of study. A Masters degree will allow you to gain a certain level of in-depth subject knowledge, and this is vital to have as a base level for continuing on in further study and obtaining a doctorate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eStudying a Masters abroad in the UK\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are ready to start your postgraduate study, and want to explore studying abroad options, the Kingston University International Study Centre may be the right place for you.

There are two types of Masters degree. Taught Masters are similar in structure to an undergraduate degree but to a more advanced level, you will attend lectures and seminars, working towards your dissertation. A research Masters allows you to work on a topic independently and further your chosen field of study to produce a paper for publishing.

You will be expected to have autonomy over your learning and spend time researching ideas that you have not been specifically asked to. Along with this, you will gain the necessary skills for your personal development, like motivation, independence and time management.

A doctorate will make you a leading expert in your field, and allow you to continue your research in highly specialised topics. A Masters degree is necessary to continue to this level as it develops your independent research skills and knowledge ready for the highest achievement in academia. A PhD can take anything between 3 and 6 years to complete, and will likely include some teaching work as you educate others with your expertise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAcademic recognition\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFar fewer people attain a Masters degree than a Bachelors.
