Each biome and habitat comes with its own selection of flora and fauna, and it may include physical features such as canyons, volcanoes, rivers, or caves. Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest. Shifting trends in human migration have resulted in a human geography that is profoundly different from that of centuries ago.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg","altText":"Geography & Travel","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg"}},{"id":3000,"title":"Health & Medicine","urlTitle":"Health-Medicine","description":"The study of the human mind and body, how these function, and how they interact—not only with each other but also with their environment—has been of utmost importance in ensuring human well-being.

The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale.

The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next? Why do heavy objects tend to fall downwards when dropped? How are birds able to fly (and why can’t I do the same?)? Human beings have long been curious about the world in which we live, striving to identify connections among the phenomenons we witness and to understand how it all works. The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science. The modern-day sciences cover a vast range of fields, including biology, chemistry, meteorology, astronomy, physics, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg","altText":"Science","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg"}},{"id":4000,"title":"Sports & Recreation","urlTitle":"Sports-Recreation","description":"Physical contests and recreational games have long played a part in human society. In both team and solo sports, the human body has been pushed to its limits in the name of improving athletic performance and in order to break record upon record. The ancient Olympic Games are an early example of the contests in which humans have engaged to showcase physical prowess. In modern times, sports and games have evolved into a lucrative and competitive industry, while other leisure activities, such as card and video games, can be competitive or just serve as a way to unwind or socialize.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg","altText":"Sports & Recreation","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg"}},{"id":2000,"title":"Technology","urlTitle":"Technology","description":"Humankind has long striven to improve its living conditions through the development of tools, instruments, and transportation and communications systems, all with the goal of making our lives easier, more productive and—why not?—more fun, too.

				<!--[BEFORE-ARTICLE]--><span class="marker before-article"></span><!--[H3]--><span class="marker h3"></span><section id="ref275879" data-level="1"><h1 class="h1">Intellectual development of Thomas Hobbes</h1><!--[TOC]--><p class="topic-paragraph">The two branches of the Cavendish family nourished Hobbes’s enduring <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="intellectual" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intellectual" data-type="MW">intellectual</a> interests in politics and natural <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/science" class="md-crosslink">science</a>, respectively. Hobbes served the earls of Devonshire intermittently until 1628; Newcastle and his brother employed him in the following decade. He returned to the Devonshires after the 1640s. Through both branches of the Cavendish family, and through contacts he made in his own right on the Continent as traveling companion to various successors to the Devonshire title, Hobbes became a member of several networks of <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="intellectuals" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intellectuals" data-type="MW">intellectuals</a> in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/England" class="md-crosslink autoxref">England</a>. Farther afield, in Paris, he became acquainted with the circle of scientists, theologians, and philosophers presided over by the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/theology" class="md-crosslink">theologian</a> <span id="ref68417"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marin-Mersenne" class="md-crosslink">Marin Mersenne</a>. This circle included <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rene-Descartes" class="md-crosslink">René Descartes</a>.</p><!--[P1]--><span class="marker p1"></span><!--[AM1]--><span class="marker AM1 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD1]--><span class="marker MOD1 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">Hobbes was exposed to practical politics before he became a student of political <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/philosophy" class="md-crosslink autoxref">philosophy</a>. The young William Cavendish was a member of the 1614 and 1621 Parliaments, and Hobbes would have followed his contributions to parliamentary debates. Further exposure to politics came through the commercial interests of the earls of Devonshire. Hobbes attended many meetings of the governing body of the <span id="ref986273"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Virginia-Company" class="md-crosslink">Virginia Company</a>, a trading company established by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-I-king-of-England-and-Scotland" class="md-crosslink">James I</a> to colonize parts of the eastern coast of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/North-America" class="md-crosslink autoxref">North America</a>, and came into contact with powerful men there. (Hobbes himself was given a small share in the company by his employer.) He also confronted political issues through his connection with figures who met at Great Tew; with them he debated not only theological questions but also the issues of how the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Anglicanism" class="md-crosslink">Anglican church</a> should be led and organized and how its <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/authority" class="md-crosslink autoxref">authority</a> should be related to that of any English civil government.</p><!--[P2]--><span class="marker p2"></span><!--[AM2]--><span class="marker AM2 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD2]--><span class="marker MOD2 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">In the late 1630s Parliament and King <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-I-king-of-Great-Britain-and-Ireland" class="md-crosslink">Charles I</a> were in conflict over how far normal kingly powers could be exceeded in exceptional circumstances, especially in regard to raising money for armies. In 1640 Hobbes wrote a <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="treatise" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/treatise" data-type="MW">treatise</a> defending the king’s own wide interpretation of his <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="prerogatives" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prerogatives" data-type="MW">prerogatives</a>. Royalist members of Parliament used arguments from Hobbes’s treatise in debates, and the treatise itself circulated in manuscript form. <em><span id="ref68422"></span>The Elements of Law, Natural and Politic</em> (written in 1640, published in a misedited unauthorized version in 1650) was Hobbes’s first work of political philosophy, though he did not intend it for publication as a book.</p><!--[P3]--><span class="marker p3"></span><!--[AM3]--><span class="marker AM3 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD3]--><span class="marker MOD3 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">The development of Hobbes the scientist began in his <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/middle-age" class="md-crosslink autoxref">middle age</a>. He was not trained in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/mathematics" class="md-crosslink">mathematics</a> or the sciences at Oxford, and his Wiltshire schooling was strongest in classical languages. His interest in <span id="ref250822"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/motion-mechanics" class="md-crosslink">motion</a> and its effects was <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="stimulated" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/stimulated" data-type="EB">stimulated</a> mainly through his conversation and reading on the Continent, as well as through his association with the scientifically and mathematically minded Wellbeck Cavendishes. In 1629 or 1630 Hobbes was supposedly charmed by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Euclid-Greek-mathematician" class="md-crosslink">Euclid</a>’s method of demonstrating theorems in the <em><span id="ref68416"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Elements-by-Euclid" class="md-crosslink">Elements</a></em>. According to a contemporary biographer, he came upon a volume of Euclid in a gentleman’s study and fell in love with <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/geometry" class="md-crosslink">geometry</a>. Later, perhaps in the mid-1630s, he had gained enough sophistication to pursue independent research in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/optics" class="md-crosslink">optics</a>, a subject he later claimed to have pioneered. Within the Wellbeck Academy, he exchanged views with other people interested in the subject. And as a member of Mersenne’s circle in Paris after 1640, he was taken seriously as a theorist not only of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/ethics-philosophy" class="md-crosslink">ethics</a> and politics but of <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="optics" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/optics" data-type="EB">optics</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ballistics" class="md-crosslink">ballistics</a>. Indeed, he was even credited with competence in mathematics by some very able French mathematicians, including <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gilles-Personne-de-Roberval" class="md-crosslink">Gilles Personne de Roberval</a>.</p><!--[P4]--><span class="marker p4"></span><!--[AM4]--><span class="marker AM4 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD4]--><span class="marker MOD4 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">Self-taught in the sciences and an innovator at least in optics, Hobbes also regarded himself as a teacher or transmitter of sciences developed by others. In this connection he had in mind sciences that, like his own optics, traced observed phenomena to principles about the sizes, shapes, positions, speeds, and paths of parts of matter. His great trilogy—<em><span id="ref986271"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/De-Corpore" class="md-crosslink">De Corpore</a></em> (1655; “Concerning Body”), <em><span id="ref986272"></span>De Homine</em> (1658; “Concerning Man”), and <em><span id="ref68421"></span>De Cive</em> (1642; “Concerning the Citizen”)—was his attempt to arrange the various pieces of natural science, as well as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/psychology" class="md-crosslink">psychology</a> and politics, into a <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="hierarchy" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hierarchy" data-type="MW">hierarchy</a>, ranging from the most general and fundamental to the most specific. Although logically <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="constituting" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constituting" data-type="MW">constituting</a> the last part of his system, <em>De Cive</em> was published first, because political turmoil in England made its message particularly timely and because its doctrine was intelligible both with and without natural-scientific preliminaries. <em>De Corpore</em> and <em>De Homine</em> incorporated the findings of, among others, <span id="ref68418"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Galileo-Galilei" class="md-crosslink">Galileo</a> on the motions of terrestrial bodies, Kepler on <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/astronomy" class="md-crosslink">astronomy</a>, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Harvey" class="md-crosslink">William Harvey</a> on the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/circulatory-system" class="md-crosslink">circulation of the blood</a>, and Hobbes himself on optics. The science of politics contained in <em>De Cive</em> was substantially anticipated in Part II of <em>The Elements of Law</em> and further developed in <em>Leviathan; or, The Matter, Form, and Power of a Commonwealth, Ecclesiastical and Civil</em> (1651), the last—and in the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/English-language" class="md-crosslink">English</a>-speaking world the most famous—formulation of Hobbes’s political philosophy (<em>see below</em> <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Hobbes/Hobbess-system#ref275883" class="md-crosslink">Hobbes’s system</a>).</p><!--[P5]--><span class="marker p5"></span><!--[AM5]--><span class="marker AM5 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD5]--><span class="marker MOD5 mod-inline"></span></section><!--[H4]--><span class="marker h4"></span><section id="ref3236" data-level="1"><h2 class="h1">Exile in Paris</h2><p class="topic-paragraph">When strife became <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="acute" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acute" data-type="MW">acute</a> in 1640, Hobbes feared for his safety. Shortly after completing <em>The Elements of Law</em>, he fled to Paris, where he rejoined Mersenne’s circle and made contact with other exiles from England. He would remain in Paris for more than a decade, working on <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Hobbes/Optics#ref275882" class="md-crosslink">optics</a> and on <em>De Cive</em>, <em>De Corpore</em>, and <em>Leviathan</em>.
