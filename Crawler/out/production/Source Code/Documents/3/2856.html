At any given time several distinct crawls are running, some for months, and some every day or longer.

<br><br>
Liveweb proxy is a component of Internet Archive’s wayback machine project. The liveweb proxy captures the content of a web page in real time, archives it into a ARC or WARC file and returns the ARC/WARC record back to the wayback machine to process. The recorded ARC/WARC file becomes part of the wayback machine in due course of time.

How We Acquire Personal Information","copy":"__A. Personal Information You Provide.__  We often receive Personal Information because you provide it to us. For instance, when you enter a contest, complete a survey, purchase a Product, or register and/or set up an account/profile or attend a conference or event, you may be provided, or required to choose, a password and/or User ID, and you may provide a credit, debit, or payment account number, or other payment information, as well as your name, telephone number(s), email and/or street address.  Other Personal Information such as your age, gender, and preferences may also be requested. In addition, we may acquire your Personal Information when you contact us by telephone, postal mail, social media interaction or messaging (e.g., email, SMS, MMS, or similar technologies).  We also may acquire Personal Information that you provide about other people, for example, when you use our “refer-a-friend” email feature or purchase one of our Products as a gift.\n\n__B. Personal Information Automatically Collected.__  The Service also automatically collects certain information, some of which may be deemed Personal Information.  The information collected may include, without limitation, information about your Device, such as the make, model, settings, specifications (e.g., CPU speed, connection speed, browser type, operating system, device identifier) and geographic location of you and/or your Device, as well as date/time stamp, IP address, webpages visited and actions taken on webpages, time of visits, Content viewed, ads viewed, the site(s), application(s), destination(s), and/or service(s) you arrived from, and other clickstream data. The Service may collect such information even if the Service is not open on your Device or you’re not logged in.  See Section VI for more information on cookies and other technologies used to automatically collect information on or through the Service.\n\n__C. Personal Information Acquired Elsewhere.__  We may also acquire your Personal Information offline, from third parties, or otherwise outside of the Service.  For example, we may purchase or otherwise acquire Personal Information from third party consumer data suppliers/resellers, data enrichment providers and aggregators, business contact databases, government entities, and our affiliates.  \n\n__D. Social Network Integration.__  If you choose to access, visit and/or use any third party social networking service(s) that may be integrated with the Service, we may receive Personal Information that has been made available to those services, including Personal Information about your contacts on those services.  For example, some social networking services allow you to push Content from our Service to your contacts or to pull information about your contacts so you can connect with them on or through our Service.  Some social networking services also will facilitate your registration for our Service or enhance or personalize your experience on our Service.  You should make sure you are comfortable with your Personal Information the third party social networking services may make available to us by visiting those services' privacy policies and/or modifying your privacy settings directly with those services.  We treat Personal Information that we receive through third-party social networking services in the same ways as all of your Personal Information we receive through our Service (as described in Section IV below).\n\n__E.

We and Third Party Businesses may independently use Local Device Storage in connection with the Service in a way that collects Personal Information for the purposes described in the respective privacy policies, including without limitation to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before on the same or different Device and to otherwise control and tailor the display of ads to you based on your preferences, to track the movements of individual users through the Service and elsewhere on the web or across apps, devices, and geographic locations, to help diagnose problems with servers, to gather broad demographic information, to conduct research, to deliver editorial Content, to record registration and personalization information, and to otherwise administer the Service.  For example, if you register on any part of the Service and are given the option to save your user name and password, we may provide this convenience to you via Local Device Storage.\n\n__B. You May Disable Local Device Storage.__  If you do not want Local Device Storage, your Device or browser may include an option that allows you to not accept it. However, if you disable Local Device Storage, some portions of the Service may not function properly. \n\n__C. Tracking Technologies.__  In addition to Local Device Storage, we may use web beacons, web bugs, internet or pixel tags, clear gifs, digital fingerprinting (aka \"Machine Identification\") and similar technologies (collectively, together with Local Device Storage, the \"Tracking Technologies\") on the Service, including in our communications with you, such as within e-mail and text messages and push notifications.  We and Third Party Businesses use Tracking Technologies to determine which messages have been opened by recipients, and for all or some of the same lawful purposes described above for use of Local Device Storage.\n\n__D. Do Not Track (DNT).__  Your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a \"Do Not Track\" (DNT) signal to websites and online services that you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what DNT means in this context, and some browsers automatically apply DNT signals by default and therefore do not necessarily reflect our visitors’ choice as to whether they wish to receive advertisements tailored to their interests. As a result, like many websites and online services, we do not alter our practices when the Service receives a DNT signal from a visitor's browser. As discussed below, you may opt out of the use of your Personal Information for online behavioral advertising by third parties at any time.

(“CCPA”), grants residents of California certain rights with respect to their Personal Information and requires us to provide such individuals with certain information, described in this Section X(A).\n\n1.California residents may exercise the following rights by contacting our Privacy Policy Coordinator by email at Privacy_administration@condenast.com or phone at +1 888-914-9661, PIN: 867 610, or as described at the end of this document:\n\n•\tKnow the ways in which we acquire, use, share, disclose and otherwise process your Personal Information;\n•\tKnow the specific pieces of your Personal Information that we hold;\n•\tRequest the deletion of your Personal Information, subject to several exceptions; and\n•\tNot to be denied goods or services for exercising these rights\n\n2.California residents also have the right to opt-out of the “sale” of their Personal Information. We put “sale” in quotation marks because the CCPA considers some transfers of Personal Information to third parties in exchange for value as “sales,” even if no money changes hands, such as when online identifiers, Device IDs, and other information is shared with Third Party Businesses to further their own commercial purposes such as generating profiles about individuals. California residents can exercise this right here: Do Not Sell My Personal Information.  If we have actual knowledge that a California resident is younger than 16, we will request opt-in consent before selling their Personal Information. Note that we can still share Personal Information with third parties if those transfers aren’t “sales,” such as with our Service Providers.\n\n3.Depending on the circumstances and which Service you use, we have disclosed the following categories of your Personal Information for a “business purpose” (as defined in the CCPA) in the preceding twelve (12) months:\n\n  - Identifiers\n  - Protected characteristics\n  - Commercial information\n  - Geolocation data\n  - Internet or other electronic network activity information\n  - Financial, medical, or health insurance information \n  - Audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory, or similar information\n  - Professional information\n  - Education information\n  - Inferences drawn from any of the above information categories.\n\n4.Depending on the circumstances and which Service you use, we have “sold” (as defined in the CCPA) the following categories of your Personal Information in the preceding twelve (12) months:\n\n  - Identifiers\n  - Protected characteristics\n  - Commercial information\n  - Geolocation data\n  - Internet or other electronic network activity information\n  - Inferences drawn from any of the above information categories, along with  the following categories: (i) financial, medical, or health insurance information; (ii) audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory, or similar information; (iii) professional information, and (iv) education information.\n\n__B. Shine the Light.__  California’s \"Shine the Light\" law, Civil Code Section 1798.83, gives California customers the right to prevent our disclosure of their Personal Information to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business' practices related to disclosing Personal Information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose Personal Information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing.  We have such a policy in place.  As discussed above in Section X(A)(2), California residents can exercise their right to opt-out here: Do Not Sell My Personal Information.\n\n__C. Online Erasure.__  California’s \"Online Erasure\" law, Business and Professions Code Sections 22580-22582, requires operators of certain websites and online services to allow registered users who are under the age of 18 and residents of California to request removal of Content they post.
