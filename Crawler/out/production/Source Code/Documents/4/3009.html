<p>The term Industrial Revolution, like similar historical concepts, is more convenient than precise. It is convenient because history requires division into periods for purposes of understanding and instruction and because there were sufficient innovations at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries to justify the choice of this as one of the periods. The term is imprecise, however, because the Industrial Revolution has no clearly defined beginning or end. Moreover, it is misleading if it carries the implication of a once-for-all change from a “preindustrial” to a “postindustrial” society, because, as has been seen, the events of the traditional Industrial Revolution had been well prepared in a mounting tempo of industrial, commercial, and technological activity from about 1000 <span class="text-smallcaps">ce</span> and led into a continuing acceleration of the processes of industrialization that is still proceeding in our own time. The term Industrial Revolution must thus be employed with some care. It is used below to describe an extraordinary quickening in the rate of growth and change and, more particularly, to describe the first 150 years of this period of time, as it will be convenient to pursue the developments of the 20th century separately.</p><!--[P1]-->
<p>The Industrial Revolution, in this sense, has been a worldwide phenomenon, at least in so far as it has occurred in all those parts of the world, of which there are very few exceptions, where the influence of Western civilization has been felt. Beyond any doubt it occurred first in Britain, and its effects spread only gradually to continental Europe and North America. Equally clearly, the Industrial Revolution that eventually transformed these parts of the Western world surpassed in magnitude the achievements of Britain, and the process was carried further to change radically the socioeconomic life of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Australasia. The reasons for this succession of events are complex, but they were implicit in the earlier account of the buildup toward rapid industrialization. Partly through good fortune and partly through conscious effort, Britain by the early 18th century came to possess the combination of social needs and social resources that provided the necessary preconditions of commercially successful innovation and a social system capable of sustaining and institutionalizing the processes of rapid technological change once they had started. This section will therefore be concerned, in the first place, with events in Britain, although in discussing later phases of the period it will be necessary to trace the way in which British technical achievements were diffused and superseded in other parts of the Western world.</p><!--[P2]-->
<section id="ref10447" data-level="2"><h2 class="h2"><span id="ref367958"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/technology/power-source" class="md-crosslink">Power technology</a></h2>
<p>An outstanding feature of the Industrial Revolution has been the advance in power technology. At the beginning of this period, the major sources of power available to industry and any other potential consumer were animate energy and the power of wind and water, the only exception of any significance being the atmospheric steam engines that had been installed for pumping purposes, mainly in coal mines. It is to be emphasized that this use of steam power was exceptional and remained so for most industrial purposes until well into the 19th century. Steam did not simply replace other sources of power: it transformed them. The same sort of scientific inquiry that led to the development of the steam engine was also applied to the traditional sources of inanimate energy, with the result that both waterwheels and windmills were improved in design and efficiency. Numerous engineers contributed to the refinement of waterwheel construction, and by the middle of the 19th century new designs made possible increases in the speed of revolution of the waterwheel and thus prepared the way for the emergence of the water turbine, which is still an extremely efficient device for converting energy.</p><!--[P3]-->

<p>Meanwhile, British windmill construction was improved considerably by the refinements of sails and by the self-correcting device of the fantail, which kept the sails pointed into the wind. Spring sails replaced the traditional canvas rig of the windmill with the equivalent of a modern venetian blind, the shutters of which could be opened or closed, to let the wind pass through or to provide a surface upon which its pressure could be exerted. Sail design was further improved with the “patent” sail in 1807. In mills equipped with these sails, the shutters were controlled on all the sails simultaneously by a lever inside the mill connected by rod linkages through the windshaft with the bar operating the movement of the shutters on each sweep. The control could be made more fully automatic by hanging weights on the lever in the mill to determine the maximum wind pressure beyond which the shutters would open and spill the wind. Conversely, counterweights could be attached to keep the shutters in the open position. With these and other modifications, British windmills adapted to the increasing demands on power technology. But the use of wind power declined sharply in the 19th century with the spread of steam and the increasing scale of power utilization. Windmills that had satisfactorily provided power for small-scale industrial processes were unable to compete with the production of large-scale steam-powered mills.</p><!--[P4]--></section>

<p>Although the qualification regarding older sources of power is important, steam became the characteristic and ubiquitous power source of the British Industrial Revolution. Little development took place in the Newcomen atmospheric engine until <span id="ref367960"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Watt" class="md-crosslink">James Watt</a> patented a separate condenser in 1769, but from that point onward the steam engine underwent almost continuous improvements for more than a century. Watt’s <span id="ref367961"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/technology/separate-condenser" class="md-crosslink">separate condenser</a> was the outcome of his work on a model of a Newcomen engine that was being used in a University of Glasgow laboratory. Watt’s inspiration was to separate the two actions of heating the cylinder with hot steam and cooling it to condense the steam for every stroke of the engine. By keeping the cylinder permanently hot and the condenser permanently cold, a great economy on energy used could be effected. This brilliantly simple idea could not be immediately incorporated in a full-scale engine because the engineering of such machines had hitherto been crude and defective. The backing of a Birmingham industrialist, <span id="ref367962"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Matthew-Boulton" class="md-crosslink">Matthew Boulton</a>, with his resources of capital and technical competence, was needed to convert the idea into a commercial success. Between 1775 and 1800, the period over which Watt’s patents were extended, the Boulton and Watt partnership produced some 500 engines, which despite their high cost in relation to a Newcomen engine were eagerly acquired by the tin-mining industrialists of Cornwall and other power users who badly needed a more economic and reliable source of energy.</p><!--[P5]-->
<p>During the quarter of a century in which Boulton and Watt exercised their virtual monopoly over the manufacture of improved steam engines, they introduced many important refinements. Basically they converted the engine from a single-acting (i.e., applying power only on the downward stroke of the piston) atmospheric pumping machine into a versatile prime mover that was double-acting and could be applied to rotary motion, thus driving the wheels of industry. The rotary action engine was quickly adopted by British textile manufacturer <span id="ref367963"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Arkwright" class="md-crosslink">Sir Richard Arkwright</a> for use in a cotton mill, and although the ill-fated Albion Mill, at the southern end of Blackfriars Bridge in London, was burned down in 1791, when it had been in use for only five years and was still incomplete, it demonstrated the feasibility of applying steam power to large-scale grain milling. Many other industries followed in exploring the possibilities of steam power, and it soon became widely used.</p><!--[P6]-->
<p>Watt’s patents had the temporary effect of restricting the development of high-pressure steam, necessary in such major power applications as the locomotive. This development came quickly once these patents lapsed in 1800. The Cornish engineer <span id="ref367964"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Trevithick" class="md-crosslink">Richard Trevithick</a> introduced <span id="ref367965"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/technology/high-pressure-steam-engine" class="md-crosslink">higher steam pressures</a>, achieving an unprecedented pressure of 145 pounds per square inch (10 kilograms per square centimetre) in 1802 with an experimental engine at Coalbrookdale, which worked safely and efficiently. Almost simultaneously, the versatile American engineer <span id="ref367966"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Oliver-Evans" class="md-crosslink">Oliver Evans</a> built the first high-pressure steam engine in the United States, using, like Trevithick, a cylindrical boiler with an internal fire plate and flue. High-pressure <span id="ref367967"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/science/steam-power" class="md-crosslink">steam engines</a> rapidly became popular in America, partly as a result of Evans’ initiative and partly because very few Watt-type low-pressure engines crossed the Atlantic. Trevithick quickly applied his engine to a vehicle, making the first successful steam locomotive for the <span id="ref367968"></span>Penydarren tramroad in South Wales in 1804. The success, however, was technological rather than commercial because the locomotive fractured the cast iron track of the tramway: the age of the railroad had to await further development both of the permanent way and of the locomotive.</p><!--[P7]-->
<p>Meanwhile, the stationary steam engine advanced steadily to meet an ever-widening market of industrial requirements. High-pressure steam led to the development of the large beam pumping engines with a complex sequence of valve actions, which became universally known as <span id="ref367969"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/technology/Cornish-engine" class="md-crosslink">Cornish engines</a>; their distinctive characteristic was the cutoff of steam injection before the stroke was complete in order to allow the steam to do work by expanding. These engines were used all over the world for heavy pumping duties, often being shipped out and installed by Cornish engineers. Trevithick himself spent many years improving pumping engines in Latin America. Cornish engines, however, were probably most common in Cornwall itself, where they were used in large numbers in the tin and copper mining industries.</p><!--[P8]-->
<p>Another consequence of high-pressure steam was the practice of compounding, of using the steam twice or more at descending pressures before it was finally condensed or exhausted. The technique was first applied by <span id="ref367970"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Arthur-Woolf" class="md-crosslink">Arthur Woolf,</a> a Cornish mining engineer, who by 1811 had produced a very satisfactory and efficient <span id="ref367971"></span>compound beam engine with a high-pressure cylinder placed alongside the low-pressure cylinder, with both piston rods attached to the same pin of the parallel motion, which was a parallelogram of rods connecting the piston to the beam, patented by Watt in 1784. In 1845 <span id="ref367972"></span>John McNaught introduced an alternative form of compound beam engine, with the high-pressure cylinder on the opposite end of the beam from the low-pressure cylinder, and working with a shorter stroke. This became a very popular design. Various other methods of compounding steam engines were adopted, and the practice became increasingly widespread; in the second half of the 19th century triple- or quadruple-expansion engines were being used in industry and marine propulsion. By this time also the conventional beam-type vertical engine adopted by Newcomen and retained by Watt began to be replaced by horizontal-cylinder designs. Beam engines remained in use for some purposes until the eclipse of the reciprocating steam engine in the 20th century, and other types of vertical engine remained popular, but for both large and small duties the engine designs with horizontal cylinders became by far the most common.</p><!--[P9]-->
<p>A demand for power to generate electricity stimulated new thinking about the steam engine in the 1880s. The problem was that of achieving a sufficiently high rotational speed to make the dynamos function efficiently. Such speeds were beyond the range of the normal reciprocating engine (i.e., with a piston moving backward and forward in a cylinder). Designers began to investigate the possibilities of radical modifications to the reciprocating engine to achieve the speeds desired, or of devising a steam engine working on a completely different principle. In the first category, one solution was to enclose the working parts of the engine and force a lubricant around them under pressure. The <span id="ref367973"></span>Willans engine design, for instance, was of this type and was widely adopted in early British power stations. Another important modification in the reciprocating design was the <span id="ref367974"></span>uniflow engine, which increased efficiency by exhausting steam from ports in the centre of the cylinder instead of requiring it to change its direction of flow in the cylinder with every movement of the piston. Full success in achieving a high-speed steam engine, however, depended on the <span id="ref367975"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/technology/steam-turbine" class="md-crosslink">steam turbine</a>, a design of such novelty that it constituted a major technological innovation. This was invented by <span id="ref367976"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Algernon-Parsons" class="md-crosslink">Sir Charles Parsons</a> in 1884. By passing steam through the blades of a series of rotors of gradually increasing size (to allow for the expansion of the steam) the energy of the steam was converted to very rapid circular motion, which was ideal for generating electricity. Many refinements have since been made in turbine construction and the size of turbines has been vastly increased, but the basic principles remain the same, and this method still provides the main source of electric power except in those areas in which the mountainous terrain permits the economic generation of hydroelectric power by water turbines. Even the most modern nuclear power plants use steam turbines because technology has not yet solved the problem of transforming nuclear energy directly into electricity. In marine propulsion, too, the steam turbine remains an important source of power despite competition from the internal-combustion engine.</p><!--[P10]--></section>

<p>The development of electricity as a source of power preceded this conjunction with steam power late in the 19th century. The pioneering work had been done by an international collection of scientists including <span id="ref367978"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Benjamin-Franklin" class="md-crosslink">Benjamin Franklin</a> of Pennsylvania, <span id="ref367979"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alessandro-Volta" class="md-crosslink">Alessandro Volta</a> of the University of Pavia, Italy, and <span id="ref367980"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Faraday" class="md-crosslink">Michael Faraday</a> of Britain. It was the latter who had demonstrated the nature of the elusive relationship between electricity and magnetism in 1831, and his experiments provided the point of departure for both the mechanical generation of electric current, previously available only from chemical reactions within voltaic piles or batteries, and the utilization of such current in electric motors. Both the mechanical generator and the motor depend on the rotation of a continuous coil of conducting wire between the poles of a strong magnet: turning the coil produces a current in it, while passing a current through the coil causes it to turn. Both generators and motors underwent substantial development in the middle decades of the 19th century. In particular, French, German, Belgian, and Swiss engineers evolved the most satisfactory forms of armature (the coil of wire) and produced the dynamo, which made the large-scale generation of electricity commercially feasible.</p><!--[P11]-->
<p>The next problem was that of finding a market. In Britain, with its now well-established tradition of steam power, coal, and coal gas, such a market was not immediately obvious. But in continental Europe and North America there was more scope for experiment. In the United States <span id="ref367981"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Edison" class="md-crosslink">Thomas Edison</a> applied his inventive genius to finding fresh uses for electricity, and his development of the carbon-filament lamp showed how this form of energy could rival gas as a domestic illuminant. The problem had been that electricity had been used successfully for large installations such as lighthouses in which arc lamps had been powered by generators on the premises, but no way of subdividing the electric light into many small units had been devised. The principle of the <span id="ref367982"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/technology/filament-lamp" class="md-crosslink">filament lamp</a> was that a thin conductor could be made incandescent by an electric current provided that it was sealed in a vacuum to keep it from burning out. Edison and the English chemist <span id="ref367983"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Wilson-Swan" class="md-crosslink">Sir Joseph Swan</a> experimented with various materials for the filament and both chose carbon. The result was a highly successful small lamp, which could be varied in size for any sort of requirement. It is relevant that the success of the carbon-filament lamp did not immediately mean the supersession of gas lighting. Coal gas had first been used for lighting by <span id="ref367984"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Murdock-Scottish-inventor" class="md-crosslink">William Murdock</a> at his home in Redruth, Cornwall, where he was the agent for the Boulton and Watt company, in 1792. When he moved to the headquarters of the firm at Soho in Birmingham in 1798, <span id="ref367985"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Matthew-Boulton" class="md-crosslink">Matthew Boulton</a> authorized him to experiment in lighting the buildings there by gas, and gas lighting was subsequently adopted by firms and towns all over Britain in the first half of the 19th century. Lighting was normally provided by a fishtail jet of burning gas, but under the stimulus of competition from electric lighting the quality of gas lighting was greatly enhanced by the invention of the <span id="ref367986"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/technology/gas-mantle" class="md-crosslink">gas mantle</a>. Thus improved, gas lighting remained popular for some forms of street lighting until the middle of the 20th century.</p><!--[P12]-->
<p>Lighting alone could not provide an economical market for electricity because its use was confined to the hours of darkness. Successful commercial generation depended upon the development of other uses for electricity, and particularly on electric traction. The popularity of urban electric tramways and the adoption of electric traction on subway systems such as the London Underground thus coincided with the widespread construction of generating equipment in the late 1880s and 1890s. The subsequent spread of this form of energy is one of the most remarkable technological success stories of the 20th century, but most of the basic techniques of generation, distribution, and utilization had been mastered by the end of the 19th century.</p><!--[P13]--></section>

<p>Electricity does not constitute a prime mover, for however important it may be as a form of energy it has to be derived from a mechanical generator powered by water, steam, or internal combustion. The internal-combustion engine is a prime mover, and it emerged in the 19th century as a result both of greater scientific understanding of the principles of thermodynamics and of a search by engineers for a substitute for steam power in certain circumstances. In an internal-combustion engine the fuel is burned in the engine: the cannon provided an early model of a single-stroke engine; and several persons had experimented with gunpowder as a means of driving a piston in a cylinder. The major problem was that of finding a suitable fuel, and the secondary problem was that of igniting the fuel in an enclosed space to produce an action that could be easily and quickly repeated. The first problem was solved in the mid-19th century by the introduction of town gas supplies, but the second problem proved more intractable as it was difficult to maintain ignition evenly. The first successful gas engine was made by <span id="ref367988"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Etienne-Lenoir" class="md-crosslink">Étienne Lenoir</a> in Paris in 1859. It was modeled closely on a horizontal steam engine, with an explosive mixture of gas and air ignited by an electric spark on alternate sides of the piston when it was in midstroke position. Although technically satisfactory, the engine was expensive to operate, and it was not until the refinement introduced by the German inventor <span id="ref367989"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nikolaus-Otto" class="md-crosslink">Nikolaus Otto</a> in 1878 that the gas engine became a commercial success.

Gas engines became extensively used for small industrial establishments, which could thus dispense with the upkeep of a boiler necessary in any steam plant, however small.</p><!--[P14]--></section>

<p>The economic potential for the internal-combustion engine lay in the need for a light locomotive engine. This could not be provided by the gas engine, depending on a piped supply of town gas, any more than by the steam engine, with its need for a cumbersome boiler; but, by using alternative fuels derived from oil, the internal-combustion engine took to wheels, with momentous consequences. Bituminous deposits had been known in Southwest Asia from antiquity and had been worked for building material, illuminants, and medicinal products. The westward expansion of settlement in America, with many homesteads beyond the range of city gas supplies, promoted the exploitation of the easily available sources of crude oil for the manufacture of kerosene (paraffin). In 1859 the oil industry took on new significance when <span id="ref367992"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edwin-Laurentine-Drake" class="md-crosslink">Edwin L. Drake</a> bored successfully through 69 feet (21 metres) of rock to strike oil in Pennsylvania, thus inaugurating the search for and exploitation of the deep oil resources of the world. While world supplies of oil expanded dramatically, the main demand was at first for the <span id="ref367993"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/science/kerosene" class="md-crosslink">kerosene</a>, the middle fraction distilled from the raw material, which was used as the fuel in oil lamps. The most volatile fraction of the oil, gasoline, remained an embarrassing waste product until it was discovered that this could be burned in a light internal-combustion engine; the result was an ideal prime mover for vehicles. The way was prepared for this development by the success of oil engines burning cruder fractions of oil. Kerosene-burning oil engines, modeled closely on existing gas engines, had emerged in the 1870s, and by the late 1880s engines using the vapour of heavy oil in a jet of compressed air and working on the Otto cycle had become an attractive proposition for light duties in places too isolated to use town gas.</p><!--[P15]-->
<p>The greatest refinements in the heavy-oil engine are associated with the work of <span id="ref367994"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rudolf-Diesel" class="md-crosslink">Rudolf Diesel</a> of Germany, who took out his first patents in 1892. Working from thermodynamic principles of minimizing heat losses, Diesel devised an <span id="ref367995"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/technology/diesel-engine" class="md-crosslink">engine</a> in which the very high compression of the air in the cylinder secured the spontaneous ignition of the oil when it was injected in a carefully determined quantity. This ensured high thermal efficiency, but it also made necessary a heavy structure because of the high compression maintained, and also a rather rough performance at low speeds compared with other oil engines. It was therefore not immediately suitable for locomotive purposes, but Diesel went on improving his engine and in the 20th century it became an important form of vehicular propulsion.</p><!--[P16]-->
<p>Meantime the light high-speed gasoline (petrol) engine predominated. The first applications of the new engine to locomotion were made in Germany, where <span id="ref367996"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gottlieb-Daimler" class="md-crosslink">Gottlieb Daimler</a> and <span id="ref367997"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Karl-Benz" class="md-crosslink">Carl Benz</a> equipped the first motorcycle and the first motorcar respectively with engines of their own design in 1885. Benz’s “horseless carriage” became the prototype of the modern automobile, the development and consequences of which can be more conveniently considered in relation to the revolution in transport.</p><!--[P17]-->
<p>By the end of the 19th century, the internal-combustion engine was challenging the steam engine in many industrial and transport applications. It is notable that, whereas the pioneers of the steam engine had been almost all Britons, most of the innovators in internal combustion were continental Europeans and Americans. The transition, indeed, reflects the general change in international leadership in the Industrial Revolution, with Britain being gradually displaced from its position of unchallenged superiority in industrialization and technological innovation. A similar transition occurred in the theoretical understanding of heat engines: it was the work of the Frenchman <span id="ref367998"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sadi-Carnot-French-scientist" class="md-crosslink">Sadi Carnot</a> and other scientific investigators that led to the new science of thermodynamics, rather than that of the British engineers who had most practical experience of the engines on which the science was based.</p><!--[P18]-->
<p>It should not be concluded, however, that British innovation in prime movers was confined to the steam engine, or even that steam and internal combustion represent the only significant developments in this field during the Industrial Revolution. Rather, the success of these machines stimulated speculation about alternative sources of power, and in at least one case achieved a success the full consequences of which were not completely developed. This was the <span id="ref367999"></span>hot-air engine, for which a Scotsman, <span id="ref368000"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Stirling" class="md-crosslink">Robert Stirling</a>, took out a patent in 1816. The <span id="ref368001"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/technology/Stirling-engine" class="md-crosslink">hot-air engine</a> depends for its power on the expansion and displacement of air inside a cylinder, heated by the external and continuous combustion of the fuel. Even before the exposition of the laws of thermodynamics, Stirling had devised a cycle of heat transfer that was ingenious and economical. Various constructional problems limited the size of hot-air engines to very small units, so that although they were widely used for driving fans and similar light duties before the availability of the electric motor, they did not assume great technological significance. But the economy and comparative cleanness of the hot-air engine were making it once more the subject of intensive research in the early 1970s.</p><!--[P19]-->
<p>The transformation of power technology in the Industrial Revolution had repercussions throughout industry and society. In the first place, the demand for fuel stimulated the coal industry, which had already grown rapidly by the beginning of the 18th century, into continuing expansion and innovation. The steam engine, which enormously increased the need for coal, contributed significantly toward obtaining it by providing more efficient mine pumps and, eventually, improved ventilating equipment. Other inventions such as that of the miners’ safety lamp helped to improve working conditions, although the immediate consequence of its introduction in 1816 was to persuade mineowners to work dangerous seams, which had thitherto been regarded as inaccessible. The principle of the lamp was that the flame from the wick of an oil lamp was enclosed within a cylinder of wire gauze, through which insufficient heat passed to ignite the explosive gas (firedamp) outside. It was subsequently improved, but remained a vital source of light in coal mines until the advent of electric battery lamps. With these improvements, together with the simultaneous revolution in the transport system, British coal production increased steadily throughout the 19th century. The other important fuel for the new prime movers was petroleum, and the rapid expansion of its production has already been mentioned.

<span id="ref10453" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref10454" data-level="3"><h2 class="h3">Metallurgy</h2>
<p>Another industry that interacted closely with the power revolution was that concerned with metallurgy and the metal trades. The development of techniques for working with iron and steel was one of the outstanding British achievements of the Industrial Revolution. The essential characteristic of this achievement was that changing the fuel of the iron and <span id="ref368003"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/technology/steel" class="md-crosslink">steel</a> industry from charcoal to coal enormously increased the production of these metals. It also provided another incentive to coal production and made available the materials that were indispensable for the construction of steam engines and every other sophisticated form of machine. The transformation that began with a coke-smelting process in 1709 was carried further by the development of crucible steel in about 1740 and by the puddling and rolling process to produce wrought iron in 1784. The first development led to high-quality cast steel by fusion of the ingredients (wrought iron and charcoal, in carefully measured proportions) in sealed ceramic crucibles that could be heated in a coal-fired furnace. The second applied the principle of the <span id="ref368004"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/technology/reverberatory-furnace" class="md-crosslink">reverberatory furnace</a>, whereby the hot gases passed over the surface of the metal being heated rather than through it, thus greatly reducing the risk of contamination by impurities in the coal fuels, and the discovery that by puddling, or stirring, the molten metal and by passing it hot from the furnace to be hammered and rolled, the metal could be consolidated and the conversion of cast iron to wrought iron made completely effective.</p><!--[P21]-->
<span id="ref10453" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref10455" data-level="4"><h2 class="h4">Iron and steel</h2>
<p>The result of this series of innovations was that the British iron and steel industry was freed from its reliance upon the forests as a source of charcoal and was encouraged to move toward the major coalfields. Abundant cheap iron thus became an outstanding feature of the early stages of the Industrial Revolution in Britain. Cast iron was available for bridge construction, for the framework of fireproof factories, and for other civil-engineering purposes such as <span id="ref368005"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Telford" class="md-crosslink">Thomas Telford</a>’s novel cast-iron aqueducts. Wrought iron was available for all manner of mechanical devices requiring strength and precision. Steel remained a comparatively rare metal until the second half of the 19th century, when the situation was transformed by the Bessemer and Siemens <span id="ref368008"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/technology/Bessemer-process" class="md-crosslink">processes</a> for manufacturing steel in bulk. <span id="ref368006"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-Bessemer" class="md-crosslink">Henry Bessemer</a> took out the patent for his <span id="ref368007"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/technology/Bessemer-converter" class="md-crosslink">converter</a> in 1856. It consisted of a large vessel charged with molten iron, through which cold air was blown. There was a spectacular reaction resulting from the combination of impurities in the iron with oxygen in the air, and when this subsided it left mild steel in the converter. Bessemer was virtually a professional inventor with little previous knowledge of the iron and steel industry; his process was closely paralleled by that of the American iron manufacturer <span id="ref368009"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Kelly" class="md-crosslink">William Kelly</a>, who was prevented by bankruptcy from taking advantage of his invention. Meanwhile, the Siemens-Martin <span id="ref368010"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/technology/open-hearth-process" class="md-crosslink">open-hearth process</a> was introduced in 1864, utilizing the hot waste gases of cheap fuel to heat a regenerative furnace, with the initial heat transferred to the gases circulating round the large hearth in which the reactions within the molten metal could be carefully controlled to produce steel of the quality required. The open-hearth process was gradually refined and by the end of the 19th century had overtaken the Bessemer process in the amount of steel produced. The effect of these two processes was to make steel available in bulk instead of small-scale ingots of cast crucible steel, and thenceforward steel steadily replaced wrought iron as the major commodity of the iron and steel industry.</p><!--[P22]--></section>
<span id="ref10453" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref10456" data-level="4"><h2 class="h4">Low-grade ores</h2>
<p>The transition to cheap steel did not take place without technical problems, one of the most difficult of which was the fact that most of the easily available low-grade iron ores in the world contain a proportion of phosphorus, which proved difficult to eliminate but which ruined any steel produced from them. The problem was solved by the British scientists <span id="ref368011"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sidney-Gilchrist-Thomas" class="md-crosslink">S.G.

The most important effect of this innovation was to make the extensive phosphoric ores of Lorraine and elsewhere available for exploitation. Among other things, therefore, it contributed significantly to the rise of the German heavy iron and steel industry in the Ruhr. Other improvements in British steel production were made in the late 19th century, particularly in the development of alloys for specialized purposes, but these contributed more to the quality than the quantity of steel and did not affect the shift away from Britain to continental Europe and North America of dominance in this industry. British production continued to increase, but by 1900 it had been overtaken by that of the United States and Germany.</p><!--[P23]--></section></section>
<span id="ref10453" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref10457" data-level="3"><h2 class="h3">Mechanical engineering</h2>
<p>Closely linked with the iron and steel industry was the rise of mechanical engineering, brought about by the demand for steam engines and other large machines, and taking shape for the first time in the Soho workshop of Boulton and Watt in Birmingham, where the skills of the precision engineer, developed in manufacturing scientific instruments and small arms, were first applied to the construction of large industrial machinery. The engineering workshops that matured in the 19th century played a vital part in the increasing mechanization of industry and transport. Not only did they deliver the looms, locomotives, and other hardware in steadily growing quantities, but they also transformed the machine tools on which these machines were made. The <span id="ref368013"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/technology/lathe" class="md-crosslink">lathe</a> became an all-metal, power-driven machine with a completely rigid base and a slide rest to hold the cutting tool, capable of more sustained and vastly more accurate work than the hand- or foot-operated wooden-framed lathes that preceded it. Drilling and slotting machines, milling and planing machines, and a steam hammer invented by <span id="ref368014"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Nasmyth" class="md-crosslink">James Nasmyth</a> (an inverted vertical steam engine with the hammer on the lower end of the piston rod), were among the machines devised or improved from earlier woodworking models by the new mechanical engineering industry. After the middle of the 19th century, specialization within the machinery industry became more pronounced, as some manufacturers concentrated on vehicle production while others devoted themselves to the particular needs of industries such as coal mining, papermaking, and sugar refining. This movement toward greater specialization was accelerated by the establishment of mechanical engineering in the other industrial nations, especially in Germany, where electrical engineering and other new skills made rapid progress, and in the United States, where labour shortages encouraged the development of standardization and mass-production techniques in fields as widely separated as agricultural machinery, small arms, typewriters, and sewing machines. Even before the coming of the bicycle, the automobile, and the airplane, therefore, the pattern of the modern engineering industry had been clearly established. The dramatic increases in engineering precision, represented by the machine designed by British mechanical engineer Sir <span id="ref368015"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sir-Joseph-Whitworth-Baronet" class="md-crosslink">Joseph Whitworth</a> in 1856 for measuring to an accuracy of 0.000001 inch (even though such refinement was not necessary in everyday workshop practice), and the corresponding increase in the productive capacity of the engineering industry, acted as a continuing encouragement to further mechanical innovation.</p><!--[P24]--></section>
<span id="ref10453" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref10458" data-level="3"><h2 class="h3">Textiles</h2>
<p>The industry that, probably more than any other, gave its character to the <span id="ref368016"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/place/United-Kingdom" class="md-crosslink">British</a> Industrial Revolution was the cotton-textile industry. The traditional dates of the Industrial Revolution bracket the period in which the processes of cotton manufacture in Britain were transformed from those of a small-scale domestic industry scattered over the towns and villages of the South Pennines into those of a large-scale, concentrated, power-driven, mechanized, factory-organized, urban industry. The transformation was undoubtedly dramatic both to contemporaries and to posterity, and there is no doubting its immense significance in the overall pattern of British industrialization. But its importance in the history of technology should not be exaggerated. Certainly there were many interesting mechanical improvements, at least at the beginning of the transformation. The development of the spinning wheel into the spinning jenny, and the use of rollers and moving trolleys to mechanize spinning in the shape of the frame and the mule, respectively, initiated a drastic rise in the productivity of the industry. But these were secondary innovations in the sense that there were precedents for them in the experiments of the previous generation; that in any case the first British textile factory was the <span id="ref368017"></span>Derby silk mill built in 1719; and that the most far-reaching innovation in cotton manufacture was the introduction of steam power to drive carding machines, spinning machines, power looms, and printing machines. This, however, is probably to overstate the case, and the cotton innovators should not be deprived of credit for their enterprise and ingenuity in transforming the British cotton industry and making it the model for subsequent exercises in industrialization. Not only was it copied, belatedly and slowly, by the woolen-cloth industry in Britain, but wherever other nations sought to industrialize they tried to acquire British cotton machinery and the expertise of British cotton industrialists and artisans.</p><!--[P25]-->
<p>One of the important consequences of the rapid rise of the British cotton industry was the dynamic stimulus it gave to other processes and industries. The rising demand for raw cotton, for example, encouraged the plantation economy of the southern United States and the introduction of the cotton gin, an important contrivance for separating mechanically the cotton fibres from the seeds, husks, and stems of the plant.</p><!--[P26]--></section>
<span id="ref10453" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref10459" data-level="3"><h2 class="h3">Chemicals</h2>
<p>In Britain the growth of the textile industry brought a sudden increase of interest in the chemical industry, because one formidable bottleneck in the production of textiles was the long time that was taken by natural bleaching techniques, relying on sunlight, rain, sour milk, and urine. The modern chemical industry was virtually called into being in order to develop more rapid bleaching techniques for the British cotton industry. Its first success came in the middle of the 18th century, when <span id="ref368018"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Roebuck" class="md-crosslink">John Roebuck</a> invented the method of mass producing sulfuric acid in lead chambers. The acid was used directly in bleaching, but it was also used in the production of more effective chlorine bleaches, and in the manufacture of bleaching powder, a process perfected by <span id="ref368019"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Tennant" class="md-crosslink">Charles Tennant</a> at his St. Rollox factory in Glasgow in 1799. This product effectively met the requirements of the cotton-textile industry, and thereafter the chemical industry turned its attention to the needs of other industries, and particularly to the increasing demand for alkali in soap, glass, and a range of other manufacturing processes. The result was the successful establishment of the Leblanc soda process, patented by <span id="ref368020"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicolas-Leblanc" class="md-crosslink">Nicolas Leblanc</a> in France in 1791, for manufacturing sodium carbonate (soda) on a large scale; this remained the main alkali process used in Britain until the end of the 19th century, even though the Belgian <span id="ref368021"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/technology/ammonia-soda-process" class="md-crosslink">Solvay process</a>, which was considerably more economical, was replacing it elsewhere.</p><!--[P27]-->
<p>Innovation in the chemical industry shifted, in the middle of the 19th century, from the heavy chemical processes to organic chemistry. The stimulus here was less a specific industrial demand than the pioneering work of a group of German scientists on the nature of coal and its derivatives. Following their work, <span id="ref368022"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Henry-Perkin" class="md-crosslink">W.H. Perkin</a>, at the Royal College of Chemistry in London, produced the first artificial dye from aniline in 1856. In the same period, the middle third of the 19th century, work on the qualities of cellulosic materials was leading to the development of high explosives such as nitrocellulose, nitroglycerine, and dynamite, while experiments with the solidification and extrusion of cellulosic liquids were producing the first plastics, such as celluloid, and the first artificial fibres, so-called artificial silk, or rayon. By the end of the century all these processes had become the bases for large chemical industries.</p><!--[P28]-->
<p>An important by-product of the expanding chemical industry was the manufacture of a widening range of medicinal and pharmaceutical materials as medical knowledge increased and drugs began to play a constructive part in therapy. The period of the Industrial Revolution witnessed the first real progress in medical services since the ancient civilizations. Great advances in the sciences of anatomy and physiology had had remarkably little effect on medical practice. In 18th-century Britain, however, hospital provision increased in quantity although not invariably in quality, while a significant start was made in immunizing people against smallpox culminating in <span id="ref368023"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edward-Jenner" class="md-crosslink">Edward Jenner</a>’s vaccination process of 1796, by which protection from the disease was provided by administering a dose of the much less virulent but related disease of cowpox. But it took many decades of use and further smallpox epidemics to secure its widespread adoption and thus to make it effective in controlling the disease. By this time <span id="ref368024"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Louis-Pasteur" class="md-crosslink">Louis Pasteur</a> and others had established the bacteriological origin of many common diseases and thereby helped to promote movements for better public health and immunization against many virulent diseases such as typhoid fever and diphtheria.

<p>The agricultural improvements of the 18th century had been promoted by people whose industrial and commercial interests made them willing to experiment with new machines and processes to improve the productivity of their estates. Under the same sort of stimuli, agricultural improvement continued into the 19th century and was extended to food processing in Britain and elsewhere. The steam engine was not readily adapted for agricultural purposes, yet ways were found of harnessing it to threshing machines and even to plows by means of a cable between powerful traction engines pulling a plow across a field. In the United States mechanization of agriculture began later than in Britain, but because of the comparative labour shortage it proceeded more quickly and more thoroughly. The McCormick <span id="ref368026"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/topic/reaper-agriculture" class="md-crosslink">reaper</a> and the <span id="ref368027"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/topic/combine" class="md-crosslink">combine</a> harvester were both developed in the United States, as were barbed wire and the food-packing and canning industries, Chicago becoming the centre for these processes.

But the use of gunpowder, dynamite, and steam diggers helped to reduce this dependence toward the end of the 19th century, and the introduction of <span id="ref368030"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/technology/pneumatic-device" class="md-crosslink">compressed air</a> and <span id="ref368031"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/technology/hydraulic-engineering" class="md-crosslink">hydraulic</a> tools also contributed to the lightening of drudgery. The latter two inventions were important in other respects, such as in mining engineering and in the operation of lifts, lock gates, and cranes. The use of a tunneling shield, to allow a tunnel to be driven through soft or uncertain rock strata, was pioneered by the French émigré engineer <span id="ref368032"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marc-Isambard-Brunel" class="md-crosslink">Marc Brunel</a> in the construction of the first tunnel underneath the Thames River in London (1825–42), and the technique was adopted elsewhere. The iron bell or caisson was introduced for working below water level in order to lay foundations for bridges or other structures, and bridge building made great advances with the perfecting of the suspension bridge—by the British engineers Thomas Telford and <span id="ref368033"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Isambard-Kingdom-Brunel" class="md-crosslink">Isambard Kingdom Brunel</a> and the German American engineer <span id="ref368034"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Augustus-Roebling" class="md-crosslink">John Roebling</a>—and the development of the truss bridge, first in timber, then in iron. Wrought iron gradually replaced <span id="ref368035"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/technology/cast-iron" class="md-crosslink">cast iron</a> as a bridge-building material, although several distinguished cast-iron bridges survive, such as that erected at Ironbridge in Shropshire between 1777 and 1779, which has been fittingly described as the “Stonehenge of the Industrial Revolution.” The sections were cast at the Coalbrookdale furnace nearby and assembled by mortising and wedging on the model of a timber construction, without the use of bolts or rivets. The design was quickly superseded in other cast-iron bridges, but the bridge still stands as the first important structural use of cast iron. Cast iron became very important in the framing of large buildings, the elegant Crystal Palace of 1851 being an outstanding example. This was designed by the ingenious gardener-turned-architect <span id="ref368036"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Paxton" class="md-crosslink">Sir Joseph Paxton</a> on the model of a greenhouse that he had built on the Chatsworth estate of the duke of Devonshire. Its cast-iron beams were manufactured by three different firms and tested for size and strength on the site. By the end of the 19th century, however, steel was beginning to replace cast iron as well as wrought iron, and reinforced concrete was being introduced. In water-supply and sewage-disposal works, civil engineering achieved some monumental successes, especially in the design of dams, which improved considerably in the period, and in long-distance piping and pumping.</p><!--[P31]--></section>
<span id="ref10453" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref10462" data-level="3"><h2 class="h3">Transport and communications</h2>
<p>Transport and communications provide an example of a revolution within the Industrial Revolution, so completely were the modes transformed in the period 1750–1900. The first improvements in Britain came in roads and canals in the second half of the 18th century. Although of great economic importance, these were not of much significance in the history of technology, as good roads and canals had existed in continental Europe for at least a century before their adoption in Britain. A network of hard-surfaced roads was built in France in the 17th and early 18th centuries and copied in Germany. <span id="ref368037"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pierre-Marie-Jerome-Tresaguet" class="md-crosslink">Pierre Trésaguet</a> of France improved road construction in the late 18th century by separating the hard-stone wearing surface from the rubble substrata and providing ample drainage. Nevertheless, by the beginning of the 19th century, British engineers were beginning to innovate in both road- and canal-building techniques, with <span id="ref368038"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Loudon-McAdam" class="md-crosslink">J.L. McAdam</a>’s inexpensive and long-wearing road surface of compacted stones and Thomas Telford’s well-engineered canals. The outstanding innovation in transport, however, was the application of steam power, which occurred in three forms.</p><!--[P32]-->
<span id="ref10453" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref10463" data-level="4"><h2 class="h4">Steam locomotive</h2>
<p>First was the evolution of the railroad: the combination of the steam locomotive and a permanent travel way of metal rails. Experiments in this conjunction in the first quarter of the 19th century culminated in the <span id="ref368039"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Stockton-and-Darlington-Railway" class="md-crosslink">Stockton &amp; Darlington Railway</a>, opened in 1825, and a further five years of experience with steam locomotives led to the <span id="ref368040"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Liverpool-and-Manchester-Railway" class="md-crosslink">Liverpool and Manchester Railway</a>, which, when it opened in 1830, constituted the first fully timetabled railway service with scheduled freight and passenger traffic relying entirely on the steam locomotive for traction. This railway was designed by <span id="ref368041"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Stephenson" class="md-crosslink">George Stephenson</a>, and the locomotives were the work of Stephenson and his son Robert, the first locomotive being the famous <em><span id="ref368042"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Rocket-locomotive" class="md-crosslink">Rocket</a></em>, which won a competition held by the proprietors of the railway at Rainhill, outside Liverpool, in 1829. The opening of the Liverpool and Manchester line may fairly be regarded as the inauguration of the railway era, which continued until World War I. During this time railways were built across all the countries and continents of the world, opening up vast areas to the markets of industrial society. Locomotives increased rapidly in size and power, but the essential principles remained the same as those established by the Stephensons in the early 1830s: horizontal cylinders mounted beneath a multitubular boiler with a firebox at the rear and a tender carrying supplies of water and fuel. This was the form developed from the <em>Rocket</em>, which had diagonal cylinders, being itself a stage in the transition from the vertical cylinders, often encased by the boiler, which had been typical of the earliest locomotives (except Trevithick’s Penydarren engine, which had a horizontal cylinder). Meanwhile, the construction of the permanent way underwent a corresponding improvement on that which had been common on the preceding tramroads: wrought-iron, and eventually steel, rails replaced the cast-iron rails, which cracked easily under a steam locomotive, and well-aligned track with easy gradients and substantial supporting civil-engineering works became a commonplace of the railroads of the world.</p><!--[P33]--></section>
<span id="ref10453" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref10464" data-level="4"><h2 class="h4">Road locomotive</h2>
<p>The second form in which steam power was applied to transport was that of the road locomotive. There is no technical reason why this should not have enjoyed a success equal to that of the railway engine, but its development was so constricted by the unsuitability of most roads and by the jealousy of other road users that it achieved general utility only for heavy traction work and such duties as road rolling. The steam traction engine, which could be readily adapted from road haulage to power farm machines, was nevertheless a distinguished product of 19th-century steam technology.</p><!--[P34]--></section>
<span id="ref10453" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref10465" data-level="4"><h2 class="h4">Steamboats and ships</h2>
<p>The third application was considerably more important, because it transformed marine transport. The initial attempts to use a steam engine to power a boat were made on the Seine River in France in 1775, and several experimental steamships were built by <span id="ref368043"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Symington" class="md-crosslink">William Symington</a> in Britain at the turn of the 19th century. The first commercial success in steam propulsion for a ship, however, was that of the American <span id="ref368044"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Fulton-American-inventor" class="md-crosslink">Robert Fulton</a>, whose paddle steamer the “North River Steamboat,” commonly known as the <em><span id="ref368045"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Clermont-steamboat" class="md-crosslink">Clermont</a></em> after its first overnight port, plied between New York and Albany in 1807, equipped with a Boulton and Watt engine of the modified beam or side-lever type, with two beams placed alongside the base of the engine in order to lower the centre of gravity. A similar engine was installed in the Glasgow-built <em>Comet</em>, which was put in service on the Clyde in 1812 and was the first successful steamship in Europe. All the early steamships were paddle-driven, and all were small vessels suitable only for ferry and packet duties because it was long thought that the fuel requirements of a steamship would be so large as to preclude long-distance cargo carrying. The further development of the steamship was thus delayed until the 1830s, when I.K. Brunel began to apply his ingenious and innovating mind to the problems of steamship construction. His three great steamships each marked a leap forward in technique. The <em><span id="ref368046"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Great-Western-ship" class="md-crosslink">Great Western</a></em> (launched 1837), the first built specifically for oceanic service in the North Atlantic, demonstrated that the proportion of space required for fuel decreased as the total volume of the ship increased. The <em><span id="ref368047"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Great-Britain-ship" class="md-crosslink">Great Britain</a></em> (launched 1843) was the first large iron ship in the world and the first to be screw-propelled; its return to the port of Bristol in 1970, after a long working life and abandonment to the elements, is a remarkable testimony to the strength of its construction. The <em><span id="ref368048"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Great-Eastern" class="md-crosslink">Great Eastern</a></em> (launched 1858), with its total displacement of 18,918 tons, was by far the largest ship built in the 19th century. With a double iron hull and two sets of engines driving both a screw and paddles, this leviathan was never an economic success, but it admirably demonstrated the technical possibilities of the large iron steamship. By the end of the century, steamships were well on the way to displacing the sailing ship on all the main trade routes of the world.</p><!--[P35]--></section>

<p>Communications were equally transformed in the 19th century. The steam engine helped to mechanize and thus to speed up the processes of papermaking and printing. In the latter case the acceleration was achieved by the introduction of the high-speed rotary press and the <span id="ref368051"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/technology/Linotype" class="md-crosslink">Linotype</a> machine for casting type and setting it in justified lines (i.e., with even right-hand margins). Printing, indeed, had to undergo a technological revolution comparable to the 15th-century invention of movable type to be able to supply the greatly increasing market for the printed word. Another important process that was to make a vital contribution to modern printing was discovered and developed in the 19th century: photography. The first photograph was taken in 1826 or 1827 by the French physicist <span id="ref368052"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicephore-Niepce" class="md-crosslink">J.N.

In the next quarter of a century the continents of the world were linked telegraphically by transoceanic cables, and the main political and commercial centres were brought into instantaneous communication. The telegraph system also played an important part in the opening up of the American West by providing rapid aid in the maintenance of law and order. The electric telegraph was followed by the telephone, invented by <span id="ref368061"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-Graham-Bell" class="md-crosslink">Alexander Graham Bell</a> in 1876 and adopted quickly for short-range oral communication in the cities of America and at a somewhat more leisurely pace in those of Europe. About the same time, theoretical work on the electromagnetic properties of light and other radiation was beginning to produce astonishing experimental results, and the possibilities of wireless telegraphy began to be explored. By the end of the century, <span id="ref368062"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Guglielmo-Marconi" class="md-crosslink">Guglielmo Marconi</a> had transmitted messages over many miles in Britain and was preparing the apparatus with which he made the first transatlantic <span id="ref368063"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/technology/radio-technology" class="md-crosslink">radio</a> communication on Dec. 12, 1901.

<p>One area of technology was not dramatically influenced by the application of steam or electricity by the end of the 19th century: military technology. Although the size of armies increased between 1750 and 1900, there were few major innovations in techniques, except at sea where naval architecture rather reluctantly accepted the advent of the iron steamship and devoted itself to matching ever-increasing firepower with the strength of the armour plating on the hulls. The quality of artillery and of firearms improved with the new high explosives that became available in the middle of the 19th century, but experiments such as the three-wheeled iron gun carriage, invented by the French army engineer <span id="ref368065"></span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107180430/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicolas-Joseph-Cugnot" class="md-crosslink">Nicolas Cugnot</a> in 1769, which counts as the first steam-powered road vehicle, did not give rise to any confidence that steam could be profitably used in battle. Railroads and the electric telegraph were put to effective military use, but in general it is fair to say that the 19th century put remarkably little of its tremendous and innovative technological effort into devices for war.</p><!--[P38]-->
<p>In the course of its dynamic development between 1750 and 1900, important things happened to technology itself. In the first place, it became self-conscious. This change is sometimes characterized as one from a craft-based technology to one based on science, but this is an oversimplification. What occurred was rather an increase in the awareness of technology as a socially important function. It is apparent in the growing volume of treatises on technological subjects from the 16th century onward and in the rapid development of patent legislation to protect the interests of technological innovators. It is apparent also in the development of technical education, uneven at first, being confined to the French polytechnics and spreading thence to Germany and North America but reaching even Britain, which had been most opposed to its formal recognition as part of the structure of education, by the end of the 19th century. Again, it is apparent in the growth of professional associations for engineers and for other specialized groups of technologists.</p><!--[P39]-->
<p>Second, by becoming self-conscious, technology attracted attention in a way it had never done before, and vociferous factions grew up to praise it as the mainspring of social progress and the development of democracy or to criticize it as the bane of modern man, responsible for the harsh discipline of the “dark Satanic mills” and the tyranny of the machine and the squalor of urban life. It was clear by the end of the 19th century that technology was an important feature in industrial society and that it was likely to become more so. Whatever was to happen in the future, technology had come of age and had to be taken seriously as a formative factor of the utmost significance in the continuing development of civilization.</p><!--[P40]--></section></section></section>
