In order to find artifacts related to a chosen topic, curators have to sift through thousands – sometimes millions – of materials and determine which are truly relevant.\u0026nbsp; Machine learning can help streamline curatorial workflows by analyzing complex datasets and making some of their underlying patterns legible.\u0026nbsp; Yet, computers do not understand the underlying meaning of the patterns they uncover, and the results are imperfect and sometimes nonsensical.\u0026nbsp; Curators can use their expertise to make sense of machine learning outputs, and utilize them within a larger decision-making process about which materials belong in a curated compilation, and which do not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI recently co-developed an experimental machine learning tool for curators of large library or archival collections.\u0026nbsp; The tool uses market basket analysis to identify topically-related artifacts.\u0026nbsp; Pairing human expertise with machine learning tools allows curators to work more efficiently and make large, complex archival collections legible to the public.\u0026nbsp; Ultimately, the partnership between human and machine intelligence helped curators at the Digital Public Library of America uncover stories of people and communities that would have otherwise been lost or obscured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe problem of curatorial overload\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe motivation for this project originated in my experience assisting curators of the \u003ca href=\"https://blackwomenssuffrage.dp.la/\"\u003eBlack Women’s Suffrage Digital Collection\u003c/a\u003e.\u0026nbsp; Over several months, I worked with curators Shaneé Yvette Murrain and Kat Williams to explore the DPLA’s aggregation of over 40 million cultural heritage materials.\u0026nbsp; We identified artifacts related to the history of Black women’s participation in voting rights movements and included them in a curated compilation with its own discovery interface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe curators and I developed an \u003ca href=\"https://dp.la/news/searching-for-black-women-in-the-archives-part-4\"\u003eautomated query\u003c/a\u003e to select materials with relevant keywords and phrases in their \u003cstrong\u003emetadata records\u003c/strong\u003e (brief descriptions that archivists give to each artifact).\u0026nbsp; Since the DPLA aggregation grows and changes on a regular basis, the query is executed every other week to get the latest materials and add them to the Black Women\u0026#8217;s Suffrage collection.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe process of developing the final list of keywords and phrases for the biweekly query of DPLA’s aggregation proved much more difficult than we expected.\u0026nbsp; The curators started with a list of about one hundred terms related to their topic.\u0026nbsp; We soon found that there was so much variation in the ways that records were described, we would need to expand that list significantly in order to capture a comprehensive set of relevant materials.\u0026nbsp; The problem of inconsistent description is \u003ca href=\"https://dp.la/news/searching-for-black-women-in-the-archives-part-3\"\u003eespecially pronounced for materials about historically under-represented communities\u003c/a\u003e, which creates a risk that the curated collection could be biased if all appropriate subject terms are not found.\u0026nbsp;

It also makes the process of maintaining the collection over time rather daunting, as new materials are constantly being added to DPLA’s aggregation, and these new materials may include new subject terms that curators need a way to discover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eCan machine learning help?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to try using machine learning to help curators do their work faster and more efficiently.\u0026nbsp; If an algorithm could identify subject terms that are likely to be topically similar to those already selected by the curators, then these new terms could be presented to curators as suggestions that may help them find more materials related to their area of interest.\u0026nbsp; For example, if a curator started with a subject term like \u0026#8220;Antislavery movements,\u0026#8221; the algorithm might suggest \u0026#8220;Underground railroad\u0026#8221; or \u0026#8220;Sojourner Truth.\u0026#8221;\u0026nbsp;

Records following the Library of Congress standard often include compound subjects, in which individual subject terms are combined to express more granular concepts, e.g. \u0026#8220;African Americans\u0026#8211;Civil Rights\u0026#8221;

Archival artifacts are typically organized into collections, and sometimes an archivist will assign the same generic set of subject labels to every item in a collection, regardless of each item’s individual features.\u0026nbsp; There are collections in the DPLA consisting of hundreds or even thousands of artifacts with the exact same subject labels, which have the potential to skew the market basket algorithm by making the co-occurrence of certain subject terms seem much more significant than is actually merited.\u0026nbsp; To limit the influence of collection-level description, we only allowed up to 100 items with identical subject headings from any individual archives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe final preprocessed dataset included about 14 million records and about 3 million normalized subject terms.\u0026nbsp;

Finding frequent pairs within the dataset requires the most computational resources of any step in the algorithm.\u0026nbsp; Given that there are about 3 million unique subject terms, that means that there are about 4.5 trillion possible pairs of terms.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGranted, all 4.5 trillion possible pairs would not actually occur in the dataset, but it is still a large upper boundary on the computation, even with big data tools like Apache Spark and AWS cloud clusters at our disposal.\u0026nbsp; As you iterate through the dataset, you need to hold in memory a list of all the pairs you’ve encountered, and how many times you’ve seen them.\u0026nbsp; Some back-of-the-napkin calculations show that with our dataset, it would take about 90 terabytes of memory to count 4.5 trillion pairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe graduate student team’s approach to finding frequent pairs is based on the \u003cstrong\u003eApriori algorithm\u003c/strong\u003e.\u0026nbsp; This algorithm starts by finding all items in a dataset that occur frequently as singletons (e.g. subject terms that appear in many records), and then uses this information to streamline the search for frequent pairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf a pair of items occurs frequently within a dataset, then it follows that each item in the pair also occurs frequently.\u0026nbsp; Say the subjects \u0026#8220;Civil rights\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;Voting\u0026#8221; occur together 100 times.\u0026nbsp; That means that \u0026#8220;Civil rights\u0026#8221; appears at least 100 times in the dataset, as does \u0026#8220;Voting.\u0026#8221;\u0026nbsp; By the same logic, if an item is infrequent as a singleton, it cannot be part of a frequent pair.\u0026nbsp; In the search for frequent pairs, you can therefore ignore all pairs that contain an infrequent singleton.\u0026nbsp; This reduces the memory required for computation – any pair that you ignore doesn’t need to be held in memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHow many times must a term or pair of terms occur in order to be considered frequent?\u0026nbsp; It depends on the dataset, and the use case.\u0026nbsp; In general, a higher \u003cstrong\u003efrequency\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ethreshold\u003c/strong\u003e means that the algorithm executes more efficiently, and it will make fewer suggestions.\u0026nbsp; A lower pair frequency will result in more suggestions, but the quality of the suggestions may be lower.\u0026nbsp; During the testing phase, we experimented with many different frequency thresholds to find one that suited our curators’ needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn market basket analysis, it is not enough for a pair to be frequent – it must have a meaningful correlation.\u0026nbsp; For example, the subject terms \u0026#8220;African Americans\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;Education\u0026#8221; are both very frequent in the aggregation, each appearing in over 70 thousand records.\u0026nbsp; They also co-occur in about 5 thousand records.\u0026nbsp; How can you tell if the presence of \u0026#8220;African Americans\u0026#8221; indicates that \u0026#8220;Education\u0026#8221; is also likely, or if the two terms are just so prevalent their co-occurrence isn’t actually that significant?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe\u003cstrong\u003e interest measurement\u003c/strong\u003e helps us make this distinction.\u0026nbsp;
