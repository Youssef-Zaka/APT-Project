<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>At DocuSign, privacy is a priority. The purpose of this document is to set out how DocuSign, Inc. and its affiliates (“us,” “our,” or “we”) collect, use, store, or otherwise process personal information about customers and other individuals (collectively "you") who access or use our websites, including docusign.com and docusign.net, our mobile applications, our web client or professional client, and/or any of our other websites, products, or services that link to this Privacy Notice (the “Services”). By using our Services, you understand that we will collect and use your personal information as described in this Privacy Notice.</p>

<p>In some cases, we may process your personal information pursuant to an agreement with a third party organization. In those cases, the terms of that agreement may govern how we process your personal information. If you believe a third party organization has asked us to process your personal information on their behalf, please consult with them in the first instance as they will be responsible for how we process your information. This Privacy Notice (“Notice”) does not apply to any third-party websites and apps that you may use, including those to which we link in our Services. You should review the terms and policies for third-party websites and apps before clicking on any links.</p>

<p>DocuSign’s core product and Services help users create, complete, and show the validity of digital or electronic transactions, such as electronically signing a contract for mobile phone services or placing a digital signature on a loan application. As part of our Services, users want us to collect and record information that helps the parties prove the validity of the transactions, such as the names of the persons who are involved in the transactions and the devices those persons use.</p>

<p>We recommend that you read this Notice in full to ensure you are fully informed about the manner in which we collect, use, store, or otherwise process your personal information as well as your privacy rights. However, if you want to skip to a particular section of this Notice, please refer to the table of contents below.</p>

<ul class="unordered-list">
	<li><strong>Identifiers and contact information</strong>. This includes your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, or electronic signature.</li>

	<li><strong>Geolocation.</strong> This includes physical location</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Personal Information We Collect Automatically.</strong> We may automatically collect personal information from you and your devices when you use our Services, including when you visit our websites or apps without logging in. For choices you may have on what information we automatically collect, please see <a href="#5">Section ­­5 </a>of this Privacy Notice.</p>

<p>The categories of personal information we may automatically collect includes:</p>

<ul class="unordered-list">
	<li><strong>Device, Usage Information, and Transactional Data. </strong>We collect personal information about how you use our Services and the devices (e.g., computers, mobile phones, tablets) you use to access our Services. This may include, but is not limited to, the following:

		<ul class="unordered-list">
			<li>IP address.</li>
			<li>Precise geolocation information that you allow our apps to access (usually from your mobile device).</li>
			<li>Unique device identifiers and device attributes, such as operating system and browser type.</li>

		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Cookies and Related Technologies</strong>. We use cookies, which are text files containing small amounts of information that are downloaded on your device, or related technologies, such as web beacons, local shared objects and tracking pixels, to collect and/or store information. For additional information about cookies and related technologies, including details of how to opt out, please read our Cookies Notice (<a href="https://www.docusign.com/company/cookie-policy">https://www.docusign.com/company/cookie-policy</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Information We Collect from Other Sources. </strong>Subject to applicable law, we may collect personal information about you from others, such as:</p>

<ul class="unordered-list">
	<li><strong>Third-Party Sources. </strong>Examples of third-party sources include marketers, partners, researchers, affiliates (like companies under common ownership or control of DocuSign), service providers, and others where they are legally allowed to share your personal information with us. For example, if you register for our Services on another website, the website may provide your personal information to us.</li>
	<li><strong>Other Customers. </strong>Other customers may give us your personal information. For example, if a customer wants you to sign an electronic document in our Services, he or she will give us your email address and name.</li>
	<li><strong>Combining Personal Information from Different Sources.</strong> We may combine the personal information we receive from other sources with personal information we collect from you (or your device) and use it as described in this Notice.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Personal Information We Collect &amp; Process on Behalf of Customers.</strong> When our business customers use certain Services, we generally process and store limited personal information on their behalf as a data processor. For example, in the context of DocuSign eSignature, when a customer uploads contracts or other documents for review or signature, we act as a data processor and process the documents on the customer's behalf and in accordance with their instructions. In those instances, the customer is the data controller and is responsible for most aspects of the processing of the personal information. If you have any questions or concerns about how personal information is processed in these cases, including how to exercise your rights as a data subject, you should contact the customer (either your employer or the individual or entity requesting your signature). If we receive any rights requests concerning instances where we act as data processor, we will forward your query on to the relevant customer.</p>

<h2><a id="2" name="2"></a>2. Use of Personal Information</h2>

<p>In general, and subject to applicable law, including consent (as required), we may use your personal information to provide, fix, and improve our Services, develop new Services, and market our companies and their products and Services. Examples of how we use the personal information we process include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

<ul class="unordered-list">
	<li>Provide you with and collect payment for the products and Services and products you request.</li>
	<li>Create your account and manage your relationship with us (e.g., communicating with you, providing you with requested information).</li>
	<li>Send you records of our relationship, including for purchases or other events.</li>
	<li>Market features, products, or special events using email or phone or send you marketing communications about third party products and services we think may be of interest to you.</li>
	<li>Record details about transactions involving electronic documents (e.g., who initiated, viewed, or signed the documents; signers’ IP addresses; timestamps). </li>
	<li>Run sweepstakes, contests, and refer-a-friend programs.</li>
	<li>Choose and deliver content and tailored advertising, and support the marketing and advertising of our Services.</li>
	<li>Create and review data about our users and how they use our Services.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Other Uses.</strong> We may combine the personal information we collect (“aggregate”) or remove pieces of personal information (“de-identify”) to limit or prevent identification of any particular user or device to help with goals like research and marketing. Once such information has been aggregated and anonymized so that it is no longer considered personal information under applicable data protection law, this Notice does not apply.</p>

<p><strong>Lawful Basis for Processing Your Personal Information</strong>. If European data protection law applies and where DocuSign acts as a data controller, our lawful basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Notice will depend on the type of personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect or use it.</p>

<p>We normally collect or use personal information only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to collect or retain personal information or may need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. For example, when we:</p>

<ul class="unordered-list">
	<li>Use personal information to create and manage an account, we do so in order to provide you with relevant Services and perform our contract with you.</li>
	<li>Gather and record data associated with use of a digital certificate or digital signature, we do so to comply with regulations.</li>
	<li>Use names and email addresses for email marketing purposes, we do so with your consent (which you can withdraw at any time) or, where permitted under applicable law, on the basis of our legitimate interests.</li>
	<li>Gather usage data and analyze it to improve our Services or ensure the security of our websites, we do so based on our legitimate interest in safeguarding and improving our Services.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the lawful basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided in <a href="#11.">Section ­­11</a> of this Notice.  Note that in situations where DocuSign acts as a processor, it is our customer who determines the appropriate legal basis associated with processing activities, and queries about the applicable lawful basis should be directed to them.</p>

</ul>

<h2><a id="4" name="4"></a>4. Retention of Personal Information</h2>

<p>We keep your personal information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain personal information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws as set out in our data retention policy and information handling standards.

<h3><u>B. The Right to Opt Out of Sales of Personal Information</u></h3>

<p>Consumers have the right to opt out of “sales” of their personal information under the CCPA. According to the CCPA, and subject to certain exceptions, a business “sells” personal information when it sells, rents, releases, discloses, disseminates, makes available, transfers, or otherwise communicates orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.</p>

<p>As explained further in <a href="#3">Section 3</a> of this Privacy Notice, we share personal information with other companies. </p>

<p>Consumers may submit requests to opt out of such sharing using the following methods:</p>

<ol class="ordered-list">
	<li>Adjust your cookie settings and select the option to opt out of respective cookie activities.  </li>
	<li>Click the link to “unsubscribe” at the bottom of any DocuSign marketing communication.</li>
	<li>Update your email/marketing preferences at the following link: <a href="https://pref.docusign.com/preference-center">https://pref.docusign.com/preference-center</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h3><u>C. The Right to Access</u></h3>

<p>Consumers have the right to request certain details about the personal information we have collected about them (generally, within the past 12 months).  This includes the right to request:</p>

<ul class="unordered-list">
	<li>The specific pieces of personal information and the categories of personal information that we have collected about them.</li>
	<li>What categories of personal information we sold or disclosed for business purposes and the categories of third parties to whom we sold or disclosed that information for a business purpose.</li>
	<li>The categories of sources from which we collected personal information.</li>
</ul>

<h3><u>D. The Right to Deletion</u></h3>

<p>Consumers have the right to request that we delete the personal information we have collected from them.  In certain circumstances, however, the CCPA allows us to retain information for particular purposes (for example, if we need to retain the information to meet our legal obligations, and for certain other limited reasons set forth by the CCPA).</p>

<h3><u>E. How to Exercise Access and Deletion Rights</u></h3>

<p>Consumers may submit requests for access to or deletion of their personal information using any of the following methods:</p>

<ol class="ordered-list">
	<li>You can access and review personal information associated with your account at any time by clicking here (<a href="https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/ndse-user-guide-manage-your-identity">https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/ndse-user-guide-manage-your-identity</a>).</li>
	<li>You may contact us via the <a href="https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/fb186a2c-cd0e-4526-943d-54aad18159e5/e10b70ee-9923-4ccc-92cc-38ee4f08dcb3">Privacy Request Portal </a>or by mail as outlined in Section 11.</li>
</ol>

<p>For security purposes, we will attempt to verify your identity prior to fulfilling your request.  If you have an account with us, we may verify your identity through your login to your account.  If you do not have an account with us, we may need to respond to your request or otherwise contact you to request additional information from you to verify your identity (including, but not limited to your name, email address, or telephone number).</p>

<p>If we are able to verify your identity, we will respond to your request to the extent we are able to and as required by law.  If we cannot verify your identity, we may request additional information from you or we may deny your request.  If we are unable to fulfill your request(s) in their entirety, we will provide further information to you about the reasons that we could not comply with your request. </p>

<p>Certain personal information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. In addition, we need certain types of personal information so that we can provide the product and Services to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use our product and Services.</p>

<h3><u>F. The Right to Nondiscrimination</u></h3>

<p>Consumers have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising their CCPA rights.  We will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods or services with respect to Consumers who choose to exercise their CCPA rights.</p>

<h3><u>G. Authorized Agents</u></h3>

<p>Consumers may designate an agent to make CCPA requests on their behalf. For Consumers who do so, we will take steps to verify both the identity of the consumer seeking to exercise their rights as described above, and to verify that the consumer’s agent has been authorized by them to make a request on their behalf by requesting a signed written authorization or a copy of a power of attorney.</p>
