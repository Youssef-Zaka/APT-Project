Only about 40 percent of the missions ever sent to Mars – by any space agency - have been successful. Hundreds of things have to go just right during this nail-biting drop. What’s more, Perseverance has to handle everything by itself. During the landing, it takes more than 11 minutes to get a radio signal back from Mars, so by the time the mission team hears that the spacecraft has entered the atmosphere, in reality, the rover is already on the ground. So, Perseverance is designed to complete the entire EDL process by itself – autonomously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e"]],["//lh3.googleusercontent.com/KSAd5yRQQc9PsmnQujjvBGQ9sAwwHJP77-YmeCIEDpJqDtATOUlxy46FciKP08YAZ2M","Final Approach",[null,"\u003cp\u003eTen minutes before entering the atmosphere, the spacecraft sheds its cruise stage, which houses solar panels, radios, and fuel tanks used during its flight to Mars.
