    <p>Twitter allows you to access certain features in exchange for a one-time or recurring fee, as applicable to the relevant features (each a “Paid Service” and collectively the &#34;Paid Services&#34;). For example, Twitter Blue, Ticketed Spaces, and Super Follows would each be considered a “Paid Service.” </p>
<p>To the extent that you sign up for and/or use a Paid Service, your use of the Paid Services and any corresponding transactions are subject to: (i) the terms and conditions set forth herein, including the applicable terms and conditions for each Paid Service you purchase, each as listed below (collectively, the “Twitter Purchaser Terms of Service”) and (ii) the applicable <a href="https://twitter.com/tos" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter Terms of Service</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter Privacy Policy</a>, <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies#twitter-rules" rel="nofollow">Twitter Rules and Policies</a>, and all policies incorporated therein (collectively, the “Twitter User Agreement”). This Twitter Purchaser Terms of Service and the aforementioned Twitter User Agreement shall be collectively referred to in this document as the “Terms”. “Twitter” refers to the Twitter entity that provides the Paid Services to you.</p>
<p><b><u>Please read these Twitter Purchaser Terms of Service carefully to make sure you understand the applicable terms, conditions and exceptions. IF YOU LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES, THESE TERMS CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT APPLY TO YOU ABOUT RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT, INCLUDING A WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO BRING CLAIMS AS CLASS ACTIONS AND THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT, AND A LIMITATION ON YOUR RIGHT TO BRING CLAIMS AGAINST TWITTER MORE THAN 1 YEAR AFTER THE RELEVANT EVENTS OCCURRED, WHICH IMPACT YOUR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS IF ANY DISPUTE WITH TWITTER ARISES. SEE <a href="#section6-arbitration" rel="nofollow">SECTION 6</a> UNDER GENERAL TERMS FOR DETAILS ON THESE PROVISIONS.</u></b></p>
<p><b><u>Acceptance</u></b>. By using or accessing Paid Service(s), submitting payment thereunder and/or clicking on a button to make a one-time purchase or recurring subscription payments, you agree to be bound by the Terms. If you do not understand the Terms, or do not accept any part of them, then you may not use or access any Paid Services. To purchase and use a Paid Service you must: (i) be at least 18 years old or the age of majority as determined by the laws of the jurisdiction in which you live or (ii) have the express consent of your parent or guardian to purchase and use that Paid Service. If you are a parent or legal guardian and you allow your child (or a child that you are a guardian of) to purchase or use a Paid Service, you agree that the Terms apply to you, that you will abide by the Terms, and that you are responsible for the child’s activity on the Paid Services and for ensuring that the child also abides by the Terms. In any case, as stated in the Who May Use the Services section of the Twitter Terms of Service, you must be at least 13 years old to use the Twitter Service.</p>
<p><b><u>Twitter Contracting Entity</u></b>. You enter into this Twitter Purchaser Terms of Service with the entity that corresponds to where you live, as listed below. This entity will provide the Paid Services to you.</p>

<p><b><u>Changes to Terms, Paid Services and Pricing</u></b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">1. <u>Changes to Terms</u>. Twitter may revise these Twitter Purchaser Terms of Service from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most current version of the Twitter Purchaser Terms of Service, available at <a href="http://legal.twitter.com/purchaser-terms" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">legal.twitter.com/purchaser-terms</a>, will govern your use of Paid Services and any corresponding transactions. If we modify or revise these Terms after you have agreed to them (for example, if these terms are modified after you have purchased a subscription), we will notify you in advance of material revisions to these terms. Such notification may be provided electronically, including (and without limitation to) via a service notification or an email to the email address associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Paid Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Twitter Purchaser Terms of Service. If you do not agree to abide by these or any future Twitter Purchaser Terms of Service, do not use or access (or continue to use or access) the Paid Services.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">2. <u>Changes to Paid Services</u>. Our Paid Services evolve constantly. As such, the Paid Services may change from time to time, at our discretion. We may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Paid Services or any features within the Paid Services to you or to users generally with or without notice. Twitter is not liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Paid Services. The specific terms and conditions (included below) for the specific Paid Service specify how you can cancel a subscription or, when applicable, seek a refund. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">3. <u>Changes to Pricing</u>. Prices for Paid Services, including recurring subscription fees, are subject to change from time to time. Twitter will provide reasonable advance notice of any material change to the price of Paid Services. For subscription services, price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. If you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by cancelling your subscription to the applicable Paid Service prior to the price change going into effect.</p>

    <div class="cr02-copy twtr-rte twtr-component-space--md">



  <div class="twtr-color--black-neutral">
    <p><b><u>Payment Terms</u></b>. Twitter offers various payment options that may vary by Paid Service, your device and/or operating system, your geographic location, or other factors. To the extent available (as Twitter may make various purchase methods available from time to time), these payment options may include the ability to use “In app payment” functionality offered by Google or Apple, or to make a web payment using Twitter’s third party payment processor, Stripe (<a href="http://www.stripe.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">www.stripe.com</a> - hereafter “Stripe”). When you make a payment, you explicitly agree: (i) to pay the price listed for the Paid Service, along with any additional amounts relating to applicable taxes, credit card fees, bank fees, foreign transaction fees, foreign exchange fees, and currency fluctuations; and (ii) to abide by any relevant terms of service, privacy policies, or other legal agreements or restrictions (including additional age restrictions) imposed by Google, Apple, or Stripe (as Twitter’s third party payment processor) in connection with your use of a given payment processing method (for example only, if you choose to process your payment via Apple’s in-app purchasing functionality, you agree to abide by any relevant terms, requirements, and/or restrictions imposed by Apple). Any private personal data that you provide in connection with your use of the Paid Services including, without limitation, any data provided in connection with payment, will be processed in accordance with the <a href="https://twitter.com/en/privacy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter Privacy Policy</a>. Twitter may share your payment information with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect, and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit and debit cards. It is your responsibility to make sure your banking, credit card and/or other payment information is up to date, complete and accurate at all times. If you make a payment for a Paid Service, we may receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, when a subscription is set to expire or auto-renew, what platform you made the purchase on, and other information. Twitter will not be responsible or liable for any errors made or delays by a payment processor, Apple’s App Store or the Google Play Store, your bank and/or your credit card company. Please refer to each specific Paid Service Terms and Conditions below for payment terms applicable to that specific Paid Service, including how subscription renewals are handled and other important terms.</p>

    <p><b><u>Application of Twitter User Agreement, Termination, No Refunds, Multiple Twitter Accounts, and Restrictions</u></b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">1. <b>The Twitter User Agreement Applies to You</b>. YOU MUST ALWAYS FOLLOW AND COMPLY WITH THE TWITTER USER AGREEMENT. The Twitter User Agreement always applies to your use of the Twitter Service, including the Paid Services and features. Your failure to follow and comply with the Twitter User Agreement, or Twitter’s belief that you have failed to follow and comply with the Twitter User Agreement, may result in the cancellation of your Paid Services. Any such cancellation will be in addition to, and without limitation of, any enforcement action that Twitter may take against you pursuant to the Twitter User Agreement. In such instances you may lose the benefits of your Paid Services and you will not be eligible for a refund for any amounts you have paid (or pre-paid) for Paid Services.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">2. <b>Why Twitter Might Terminate Your Access to Paid Services.</b> Twitter may suspend or terminate your access to Paid Service(s) or cease providing you with all or part of the Paid Services (without any liability) at any time for any or no reason, including, but not limited to any of the following reasons:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">a. Twitter believes, in its sole discretion, that you have violated the Terms or your use of the Paid Service(s) would violate any applicable laws;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">b. Twitter is requested or directed to do so by any competent court of law, regulatory authority, or law enforcement agency;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">c. Twitter has unexpected technical or security issues;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">d. Twitter believes you have violated the Twitter User Agreement;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">e. You create risk or possible legal exposure for Twitter;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">f. Your account should be removed due to unlawful conduct;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">g. Your account should be removed due to prolonged inactivity; or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">h. Our provision of the Paid Services (in whole or in part) to you is no longer commercially viable (in Twitter’s sole discretion).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">3. <b>All Transactions Are Final</b>. All payments for Paid Services are final and not refundable or exchangeable, except as required by applicable law. We make no guarantee as to the nature, quality, or value of a Paid Service or the availability or supply thereof. Refunds or credits are not provided for any unused or partially used Paid Service (for example, a partially used subscription period). </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">4. <b>Paid Services Are Non-Transferable between Twitter Accounts</b>. Each purchase of a Paid Service applies to a single Twitter account, meaning that your purchase will apply solely to the account you were using when you purchased the Paid Service and will not apply to other accounts that you may have access to, or control over. If you have or control multiple accounts and you want access to Paid Services on each account, you must purchase the Paid Service on each account individually.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">5. <b>Restrictions and Obligations</b>. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">a. You may only purchase and use a Paid Service if you are legally allowed to use the Paid Service in your country and you live in a country supported by Twitter for the applicable Paid Service. Twitter may, in its discretion, restrict the ability to access or purchase a Paid Service in certain countries. Twitter reserves the right to modify the list of supported countries from time to time.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">b. We reserve the right to refuse Paid Services transactions or to cancel or discontinue the sale or use of a Paid Service in our sole discretion. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">c. You may not allow others to use your Twitter account to access any Paid Service that such person did not order.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">d. You may not purchase or use a Paid Service if you are a person with whom U.S. persons are not permitted to have dealings pursuant to economic sanctions, including, without limitation, sanctions administered by the United States Department of the Treasury&#39;s Office of Foreign Assets Control or any other applicable sanctions authority (&#34;Prohibited Person&#34;). This includes, without limitation, persons located in, or a citizen of, or ordinarily resident in, the following countries and regions: Cuba, Iran, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, North Korea and Syria. You represent and warrant that you are not a Prohibited Person.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">e. YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU WILL USE THE PAID SERVICES ONLY FOR LAWFUL PURPOSES AND ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4. <b>Notice Regarding Apple</b>. To the extent that you purchased the Paid Services or are using or accessing the Paid Services on an iOS device, you further acknowledge and agree to the terms of this Section. You acknowledge that the Terms are between you and us only, not with Apple, and Apple is not responsible for the Paid Services and the content thereof. Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support service with respect to the Paid Services. In the event of any failure of the Paid Services to conform to any applicable warranty, then you may notify Apple and Apple will refund any applicable purchase price for the Paid Services to you; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Paid Services. Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third-party relating to the Paid Services or your possession and/or use of the Paid Services, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Paid Services fail to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any third-party claim that the Paid Services and/or your possession and use of the mobile application infringe that third-party’s intellectual property rights. You agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms when using the Paid Services.

  <div class="twtr-color--black-neutral">
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">6. <b>DISPUTE RESOLUTION AGREEMENT--BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b><u>THIS SECTION APPLIES TO YOU ONLY IF YOU LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES</u>. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">a. <u>General</u>. <b>The following provisions are important with respect to the agreement between you and Twitter regarding Twitter’s features or products memorialized by these Terms. Subject to the provisions below, including exceptions set forth in this Section 6, you and Twitter agree to arbitrate any disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to these Terms, the marketing of Paid Services, and/or your participation in the Paid Services (individually a “Dispute,” or more than one, “Disputes”). </b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">b. <u>Initial Dispute Resolution</u>. Most disputes between you and us can be resolved informally. If you’ve already purchased a Paid Service, our support team is available via the support link available in the navigation menu of your Twitter account under the payment or subscription settings to address any concerns you may have regarding the Paid Services. When you contact us, please provide a brief description of the nature and bases for your concerns, your contact information and the specific relief you seek. The parties shall use their best efforts through this support process to settle any Dispute. You and we agree that good faith participation in this informal process is required and must be completed as set forth above before either party can initiate arbitration regarding any Dispute.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">c. <b><u>BINDING ARBITRATION</u></b>. If we cannot reach an agreed upon resolution with you regarding a Dispute within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution commences under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either you or we may initiate binding arbitration, which will be the sole means to resolve any Dispute, subject to the terms set forth below and except for claims brought in small claims court or unless you opt out. Specifically, all Disputes shall be finally resolved exclusively through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in San Francisco, CA, and through a single mutually agreed upon arbitrator, in accordance with the provisions of the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules, available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1.800.778.7879. <b>YOU AND TWITTER HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR JUDGE.</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Twitter Purchaser Terms of Service are void or voidable, or whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity, provided that such relief (including injunctive relief) is limited to your individual circumstances. Notwithstanding the requirements of this arbitration provision, if the Dispute involves a claim for public injunctive relief, you may choose to sever that claim from the arbitration proceeding and bring it in any court of proper jurisdiction. The arbitrator’s award shall be written and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">YOU HAVE ONE YEAR TO BRING A CLAIM AGAINST TWITTER, UNLESS YOU OPT OUT. You must bring any claim against Twitter within one (1) year after the date on which the claim arose, unless applicable law provides that the normal statute of limitations for that claim may not be shortened by agreement. If you do not bring a claim within this period, you waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all rights you have to such claim and Twitter will have no liability with respect to such claim.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">d. <u>Filing Process and Costs</u>. To start an arbitration, you can get submission instructions at: https://adr.org/Support. Twitter will pay your initial filing fee of $200 and costs of the arbitration up to the extent required and as defined in the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, but in no greater amounts than those set forth in this provision. If, however, the arbitrator determines that claims were filed for the purposes of harassment or were patently frivolous, the arbitrator can reallocate the arbitrator’s compensation and administrative fees, including the filing and hearing fees, as set forth in the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. The arbitration rules also permit you to recover attorneys’ fees in certain cases. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">e. <u>Location</u>. Arbitration will take place on a documents-only basis or you can choose to conduct the proceedings by telephone, video, or in-person. For in-person arbitration, the proceedings will be in the city or county where you reside or, if you do not reside in the United States, in the State of California, County of San Francisco. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">f. <u>Class Action Waiver</u>. YOU AND WE FURTHER AGREE THAT ANY CLAIMS MAY ONLY BE BROUGHT IN OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES AND NOT ON BEHALF OF, OR AS PART OF, A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS. Unless you and we both agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">g. <u>Severability</u>. If it is determined that any part of this Dispute Resolution Agreement cannot be enforced as to a particular claim for relief or remedy (such as injunctive relief), then that claim or remedy (and only that claim or remedy) shall be severed and must be brought in a court of proper jurisdiction and any other claims must be arbitrated.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">h. <u>Exception - Litigation of Small Claims Court Claims</u>. Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court&#39;s jurisdiction.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">i. <u>30-Day Right to Opt Out</u>. If you wish to opt out and not be bound by these arbitration provisions set forth above, you can send written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">Twitter, Inc.<br />
Attn: Legal Department - Arbitration Opt Out<br />
1355 Market Street, Suite 900<br />
San Francisco, CA 94103</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">If you’ve already purchased a Paid Service, you may also submit your opt out notice via the support link available in the navigation menu of your Twitter account under the payment or subscription settings. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">Your written notification must include your name, Twitter account handle, the email address or phone number associated with your account handle, and a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve Disputes with Twitter.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first payment for a Paid Service, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those provisions. Your decision to opt out of this arbitration provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with Twitter or the delivery of features or services to you by Twitter. If you opt out of those provisions, Twitter also will not be bound by them.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">j. <u>Changes to this Section</u>. We will provide 60-days’ notice of any material change to this Dispute Resolution Agreement. Changes will become effective on the 60th day, and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 60th day.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">k. <u>Choice of Law</u>. THESE TERMS MEMORIALIZE A TRANSACTION IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE.

    <p><b><u>Ticketed Spaces Terms and Conditions</u></b></p>
<p><i>These Ticketed Spaces Terms and Conditions govern your purchase of a virtual ticket (“Ticket”) to gain access to, listen to and/or participate in a live audio conversation created and hosted by a creator  (“Host”), called a “Ticketed Space”. Your purchase of a Ticket will be subject to the Terms, including the following Ticketed Spaces Terms and Conditions:</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">1. <b>Ticketed Spaces Description</b>. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">a. A Host can earn a share of revenue from a Ticket purchased from Twitter to virtually attend the Host’s Ticketed Space, as further described on our <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces-ticketed" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">About Ticketed Spaces</a> page. To gain access to a Ticketed Space, you will need to purchase a Ticket. You may purchase a Ticket through various purchase methods offered by Twitter, which may include in-app purchase via Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store (as may be released by Twitter from time to time). Each Host will set the price of each Ticket for their Ticketed Space and the number of total Tickets available for that Ticketed Space. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Twitter may, in our discretion, place restrictions or limitations on how many Tickets you may purchase and/or who may purchase a Ticket (for example, a minimum age requirement to purchase a Ticket for a particular Ticketed Space). </p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">b. The occurrence and/or details of a particular Ticketed Space, including the date and time thereof, are subject to change. The Host has the ability and discretion to cancel a Ticketed Space at any time and for any reason, and the Host is solely responsible for that decision. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">c. When a Ticketed Space is cancelled for any reason, you will receive a notification and may seek a refund from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, as applicable. You can find instructions for requesting a refund for your Ticket purchase in your Purchases dashboard within your Twitter settings. You can also check out instructions on the <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces-ticketed" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">About Ticketed Spaces</a> page or our Help Center for <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/forms/paid-features/general" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">support for Paid Services</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">d. When you join a Ticketed Space, your virtual presence (including your Twitter profile photo, display name and a link to your Twitter profile) in the Ticketed Space may be publicly visible, including to the Host, others in the Ticketed Space and/or others using the Twitter Service. Your virtual presence in the Ticketed Space may be visible for as long as that Ticketed Space remains available on the Twitter Service.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">2. <b>Payment Process and Purchase Notification</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">a. When you click on a button to purchase a Ticket, you are authorizing the one-time payment for the price of the Ticket specified in the payment flow (and, if applicable, any taxes and fees described above in the Terms) and that the payment will be made via the purchase method you have selected. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">b. You will receive a confirmation if your Ticket purchase is complete. We do not guarantee that you will be able to purchase Tickets, or that Tickets will remain available, at any time prior to when you receive a purchase confirmation.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">c. Apple, Google and Stripe, Twitter’s third party payment processor, will share purchase transaction receipts with Hosts, which receipts may include your name, the platform on which you made the purchase, whether you received a refund and other data about your purchase. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">3. <b>Restrictions on Purchasing and Using Tickets</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">a. Tickets are solely for use on Twitter to virtually attend a Ticketed Space. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">b. You may access a Ticketed Space solely for your own use. You may not: (a) record, copy, share access to, transmit, or otherwise distribute any content from a Ticketed Space through any means, or (b) resell your Ticket to any Ticketed Space.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">c. A Host and any person selected by the Host to co-host the Ticketed Space (“Co-Host”) may choose, in the Host’s or Co-Host’s discretion, to block people who have purchased Tickets to the Host’s Ticketed Space for any reason, and the Host and Co-Host are solely responsible for that decision. If you are blocked by the Host or Co-Host before the Ticketed Space occurs, you will not be able to access the Ticketed Space. You can find instructions for seeking a refund from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, as applicable, in your Purchases dashboard within your Twitter settings. You can also check out instructions on our <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces-ticketed" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">About Ticketed Spaces</a> page or our Help Center for <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/forms/paid-features/general" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">support for Paid Services</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">d. A Host may determine to offer incentives or rewards to those who purchase Tickets to the Host’s Ticketed Space. Such incentives or rewards are offered solely by the Host, not Twitter. Twitter does not control whether or not the Host actually will deliver the incentive or reward to you, and Twitter is not responsible/liable for any incentives or rewards the Host may offer.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">e. A Ticket is not exchangeable for the face value amount paid for the Ticket, or for any amount.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">f. Tickets may not be sold or resold by third parties.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">g. Your Ticket will only allow you access to the Ticketed Space during the scheduled time for that Ticketed Space. Any Tickets purchased and not used by you will not be refunded.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">4. <b>Operating System and Geographic Limitations</b>. Ticketed Spaces, and associated features and benefits, may only be supported on certain operating systems and in certain geographic regions (as Twitter releases from time to time), meaning that you may not have access to some or all of the features or benefits of a Ticketed Space (including the ability to purchase a Ticket) while accessing your Twitter account via a system that is not currently supported by Twitter or in a geographic location where Ticketed Spaces is not offered. Additionally, the features and benefits of Ticketed Spaces may vary by country. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">5. <b>No Endorsement of Content</b>. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">a. You agree that each Host is solely liable for the Content that is shared by the Host through the Twitter Service, including in a Ticketed Space. The Host, and not Twitter, is responsible for producing and providing the Content.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">b. <b>To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, you voluntarily assume all risks incidental to purchasing a Ticket, whether occurring before, during or after the Ticketed Space takes place (or is scheduled to take place)</b>. As stated in the Content on the Services section of the Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/tos" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Terms of Service</a>, Twitter does not endorse, support, represent or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any Content or communications posted via the Twitter Service, including in a Ticketed Space, or endorse any opinions expressed in a Ticketed Space.</p>
