<p>This document collects reported cases where the anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA have been invoked not against pirates, but against consumers, scientists, and legitimate competitors. It will be updated from time to time as additional cases come to light. <a href="/wp/unintended-consequences-under-dmca/archive">Previous versions</a> remain available.&#13;</p>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<div></div>
<p>Since they were enacted in 1998, the "anti-circumvention" provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), codified in section 1201 of the Copyright Act, have not been used as Congress envisioned. Congress meant to stop copyright infringers from defeating anti-piracy protections added to copyrighted works and to ban the "black box" devices intended for that purpose.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref1_kzahqxn" title="For examples of Congress' stated purpose in enacting the DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions, see 144 Cong. Rec. H7093, H7094-5 (Aug. 4, 1998); Senate Judiciary Comm., S. Rep. 105-190 (1998) at 29; Judiciary Comm., H. Rep. 105-551 Pt 1 (1998) at 18; House Commerce Comm., H. Rep. 105-551 Pt 2 (1998) at 38." href="#footnote1_kzahqxn">1</a></p>
<p>In practice, the anti-circumvention provisions have been used to stifle a wide array of legitimate activities, rather than to stop copyright infringement. As a result, the DMCA has developed into a serious threat to several important public policy priorities:&#13;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The DMCA Chills Free Expression and Scientific Research.</b> Experience with section 1201 demonstrates that it is being used to stifle free speech and scientific research. The lawsuit against <i>2600</i> magazine, threats against Princeton Professor Edward Felten's team of researchers, and prosecution of Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov have chilled the legitimate activities of journalists, publishers, scientists, students, programmers, and members of the public.</li>
<li><b>The DMCA Jeopardizes Fair Use. </b>By banning all acts of circumvention, and all technologies and tools that can be used for circumvention, the DMCA grants to copyright owners the power to unilaterally eliminate the public's fair use rights. Already, the movie industry's use of encryption on DVDs has curtailed consumers' ability to make legitimate, personal-use copies of movies they have purchased.</li>
<li><b>The DMCA Impedes Competition and Innovation.</b>Rather than focusing on pirates, some have wielded the DMCA to hinder legitimate competitors. For example, the DMCA has been used to block aftermarket competition in laser printer toner cartridges, garage door openers, and computer maintenance services. Similarly, Apple has used the DMCA to tie its iPhone and iPod devices to Apple's own software and services.</li>
<li><b>The DMCA Interferes with Computer Intrusion Laws.</b>Further, the DMCA has been misused as a general-purpose prohibition on computer network access, a task for which it was not designed and to which it is ill-suited. For example, a disgruntled employer used the DMCA against a former contractor for simply connecting to the company's computer system through a virtual private network ("VPN").</li>
</ul>
<h2>DMCA Legislative Background</h2>
<p>Congress enacted the DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions in response to two pressures. First, Congress was responding to the perceived need to implement obligations imposed on the U.S. by the 1996 World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty. Second (as reflected in the details of section 1201, which go well beyond anything the WIPO treaty required<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref2_fym0jih" title="See WIPO Copyright Treaties Implementation Act and Online Copyright Liability Limitation Act: Hearing on H.R. 2281 and H.R. 2280 before the House Subcomm. on Courts and Intellectual Prop., 105th Cong., 1st sess. (Sept. 16, 1997) at 62 (testimony of Asst. Sec. of Commerce and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks Bruce A. Lehman admitting that section 1201 went beyond the requirements of the WIPO Copyright Treaty). " href="#footnote2_fym0jih">2</a>), Congress was also responding to the concerns of copyright owners that their works would be widely pirated in the networked digital world.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref3_gcl6q73" title="For a full description of the events leading up to the enactment of the DMCA, see Jessica Litman, Digital Copyright 89-150 (2000)." href="#footnote3_gcl6q73">3</a></p>
<p>Section 1201 contains two distinct prohibitions: a ban on <b>acts</b> of circumvention, and a ban on the <b>distribution of tools and technologies</b> used for circumvention.&#13;</p>
<p>The "act" prohibition, set out in section 1201(a)(1), prohibits the act of circumventing a technological measure used by copyright owners to control access to their works ("access controls"). So, for example, this provision makes it unlawful to defeat the encryption system used on DVD movies. This ban on acts of circumvention applies even where the purpose for decrypting the movie would otherwise be legitimate. As a result, the motion picture industry maintains that it is unlawful to make a digital copy ("rip") of a DVD you own for playback on your iPod.&#13;</p>
<p>The "tools" prohibitions, set out in sections 1201(a)(2) and 1201(b), outlaw the manufacture, sale, distribution, or trafficking of tools and technologies that make circumvention possible. These provisions ban both technologies that defeat <i>access</i> controls, and also technologies that defeat use restrictions imposed by copyright owners, such as <i>copy controls</i>. These provisions prohibit the distribution of software that was designed to defeat CD copy-protection technologies, for example.&#13;</p>
<p>Section 1201 includes a number of exceptions for certain limited classes of activities, including security testing, reverse engineering of software, encryption research, and law enforcement. These exceptions have been criticized as being too narrow to be of use to the constituencies they were intended to assist.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref4_yp6kqxj" title="See Pamela Samuelson, Intellectual Property and the Digital Economy: Why the Anti-Circumvention Regulations Need to be Revised, 14 Berkeley Technology L.J. 519, 537-57 (1999)" href="#footnote4_yp6kqxj">4</a></p>
<p>A violation of any of the "act" or "tools" prohibitions is subject to significant civil and, in some circumstances, criminal penalties.&#13;</p>
<h2>Chilling Free Expression and Scientific Research</h2>
<p>Section 1201 has been used by a number of copyright owners to stifle free speech and legitimate scientific research.&#13;</p>
<p>The lawsuit against <i>2600</i> magazine, threats against Professor Edward Felten's team of researchers, and prosecution of the Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov are among the most widely known examples of the DMCA being used to chill speech and research. Bowing to DMCA liability fears, online service providers and bulletin board operators have censored discussions of copy-protection systems, programmers have removed computer security programs from their websites, and students, scientists and security experts have stopped publishing details of their research.&#13;</p>
<p>These developments weaken security for all computer users (including, ironically, for copyright owners counting on technical measures to protect their works), as security researchers shy away from research that might run afoul of section 1201.&#13;</p>
<p><b>Apple Threatens BluWiki</b>&#13;</p>
<p>In 2009, Apple threatened the free wiki hosting site BluWiki for hosting a discussion by hobbyists about reverse engineering iPods to interoperate with software other than Apple's own iTunes. Without a work-around, iPod and iPhone owners would be unable to use third-party software, such as Winamp or Songbird, to "sync" their media collections between computer and iPod or iPhone.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref5_qezqfu8" title="Robert McMillan, &quot;Apple is Sued after Pressuring Open-Source iTunes Project,&quot; PC World, Apr. 29, 2009 http://www.pcworld.com/article/163909/apple_is_sued_after_pressuring_opensource_itunes_project.html." href="#footnote5_qezqfu8">5</a></p>
<p>The material on the public wiki was merely a discussion of the reverse engineering effort, along with some snippets of relevant code drawn from Apple software. There were no "circumvention tools," nor any indication that the hobbyists had succeeded in their interoperability efforts. Nevertheless, Apple's lawyers sent OdioWorks, the company behind BluWiki, a cease and desist letter threatening legal action under the DMCA.&#13;</p>
<p>Bluwiki ultimately sued Apple to defend the free speech interests of its users.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref6_675483i" title="Katie Marshal, &quot;Apple Sued for Threatening Wiki Host over iTunes Code,&quot; Apple Insider, Apr. 27, 2009 http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/04/27/apple_sued_for_threatening_wiki_host_over_itunes_code.html." href="#footnote6_675483i">6</a>In response, Apple dropped its threat, and BluWiki reinstated the deleted pages.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref7_b1fhd24" title="Thomas Clayburn, &quot;Apple Drops Complaint Against BluWiki,&quot; Information Week, Jul. 22, 2009 http://www.informationweek.com/news/personal_tech/ipod/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=218600244." href="#footnote7_b1fhd24">7</a></p>
<p><b>DMCA Delays Disclosure of Sony-BMG "Rootkit" Vulnerability</b>&#13;</p>
<p>Professor J. Alex Halderman, then a graduate student at Princeton University, discovered the existence of several security vulnerabilities in the CD copy-protection software on dozens of Sony-BMG titles. He delayed publishing his discovery for several weeks while consulting with lawyers in order to avoid DMCA pitfalls. This left millions of music fans at risk longer than necessary.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref8_mtmd9fj" title="Comment of Edward Felten and J. Alex Halderman, RM 2005-11 — Exemption to Prohibition on Circumvention of Copyright Protection Systems for Access Control Technologies, Dec. 1, 2005, pages 6-7." href="#footnote8_mtmd9fj">8</a> The security flaws inherent in Sony-BMG's "rootkit" copy-protection software were subsequently publicized by another researcher who was apparently unaware of the legal risks created by the DMCA.&#13;</p>
<p>Security researchers had sought a DMCA exemption in 2003 in order to facilitate research on dangerous DRM systems like the Sony-BMG rootkit, but their request was denied by the U.S. Copyright Office.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref9_3qe9hc0" title="Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights in RM 2002-4, Oct. 27, 2003, pages 87-89." href="#footnote9_3qe9hc0">9</a> In 2006, the Copyright Office granted an exemption to the DMCA for researchers examining the security threat posed by copy protection software on compact discs.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref10_hc1zngj" title="Exemption to Prohibition on Circumvention of Copyright Protection Systems for Access Control Technologies, 71 Fed. Reg. 68,472, 68,477 (Nov. 27, 2006)." href="#footnote10_hc1zngj">10</a> This exemption, however, did not protect researchers studying other DRM systems.&#13;</p>
<p>In 2009, Prof. Halderman was again forced to seek a DMCA exemption from the Copyright Office in order to continue his computer security research relating to DRM systems, including the protection mechanisms used on the Electronic Arts videogame, Spore, which has been the subject of class action lawsuits alleging security vulnerabilities.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref11_7mrbdlg" title="Comments of Prof. J. Alex Halderman http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2008/comments/halderman-reid.pdf." href="#footnote11_7mrbdlg">11</a> As of February 2010, the Copyright Office had not ruled on the proposed exemption.&#13;</p>
<p><b>SunnComm Threatens Researcher</b>&#13;</p>
<p>In October 2003, then Princeton graduate student J. Alex Halderman was threatened with a DMCA lawsuit after publishing a report documenting weaknesses in a CD copy-protection technology developed by SunnComm. Halderman revealed that merely holding down the shift key on a Windows PC would render SunnComm's copy protection technology ineffective. Furious company executives then threatened legal action.&#13;</p>
<p>The company quickly retreated from its threats in the face of public outcry and negative press attention. Although Halderman was spared, the controversy again reminded security researchers of their vulnerability to DMCA threats for simply publishing the results of their research.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref12_hq7h6bb" title="John Borland, &quot;Student faces suit over key to CD locks,&quot; CNET NEWS, Oct. 9, 2003 http://news.com.com/Student+faces+suit+over+key+to+CD+locks/2100-1025_3-5089168.html; Declan McCullagh, &quot;SunnComm won't sue grad student,&quot; CNET NEWS, Oct. 10, 2003 http://news.com.com/2100-1027-5089448.html." href="#footnote12_hq7h6bb">12</a></p>
<p><b>Cyber-Security Czar Notes Chill on Research</b>&#13;</p>
<p>Speaking at MIT in October 2002, White House Cyber Security Chief Richard Clarke called for DMCA reform, noting his concern that the DMCA had been used to chill legitimate computer security research. The Boston Globe quoted Clarke as saying, "I think a lot of people didn't realize that it would have this potential chilling effect on vulnerability research."<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref13_6jgitei" title="Jonathan Band, &quot;Congress Unknowingly Undermines Cyber-Security,&quot; S.J. Mercury News, Dec. 16, 2002; Hiawatha Bray, &quot;Cyber Chief Speaks on Data Network Security,&quot; Boston Globe, October 17, 2002." href="#footnote13_6jgitei">13</a></p>
<p><b>Professor Felten's Research Team Threatened</b>&#13;</p>
<p>In September 2000, a multi-industry group known as the Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI) issued a public challenge encouraging skilled technologists to try to defeat certain watermarking technologies intended to protect digital music. Princeton computer science professor Edward Felten and a team of researchers at Princeton, Rice, and Xerox took up the challenge and succeeded in removing the watermarks.&#13;</p>
<p>When the team tried to present their results at an academic conference, however, SDMI representatives threatened the researchers with liability under the DMCA. The threat letter was also delivered to the researchers' employers and the conference organizers. After extensive discussions with counsel, the researchers grudgingly withdrew their paper from the conference. The threat was ultimately withdrawn and a portion of the research was published at a subsequent conference, but only after the researchers filed a lawsuit.&#13;</p>
<p>After enduring this experience, at least one of the researchers involved has decided to forgo further research efforts in this field.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref14_2d2gki5" title="Pamela Samuelson, &quot;Anticircumvention Rules: Threat to Science,&quot; 293 Science 2028, Sept. 14, 2001; Letter from Matthew Oppenheim, SDMI General Counsel, to Prof. Edward Felten, April 9, 2001; Felten v. RIAA: EFF Case Archive." href="#footnote14_2d2gki5">14</a></p>
<p><b>Hewlett Packard Threatens SNOsoft</b>&#13;</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard resorted to DMCA threats when researchers published a security flaw in HP's Tru64 UNIX operating system. The researchers, a loosely-organized collective known as Secure Network Operations ("SNOsoft"), received the DMCA threat after releasing software in July 2002 that demonstrated vulnerabilities that HP had been aware of for some time, but had not bothered to fix.&#13;</p>
<p>After widespread press attention, HP ultimately withdrew the DMCA threat. Security researchers got the message, however—publish vulnerability research at your own risk.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref15_w63o0gd" title="Declan McCullagh, &quot;Security Warning Draws DMCA Threat,&quot; CNET News, July 30, 2002." href="#footnote15_w63o0gd">15</a></p>
<p><b>Blackboard Threatens Security Researchers</b>&#13;</p>
<p>In April 2003, educational software company Blackboard Inc. used a DMCA threat to stop the presentation of research on security vulnerabilities in its products at the InterzOne II conference in Atlanta. Students Billy Hoffman and Virgil Griffith were scheduled to present their research on security flaws in the Blackboard ID card system used by university campus security systems but were blocked shortly before the talk by a cease-and-desist letter invoking the DMCA.&#13;</p>
<p>Blackboard obtained a temporary restraining order against the students and the conference organizers at a secret "ex parte" hearing the day before the conference began, giving the students and conference organizer no opportunity to appear in court or challenge the order before the scheduled presentation. Despite the rhetoric in its initial cease and desist letter, Blackboard's lawsuit did not mention the DMCA. The invocation in the original cease-and-desist letter, however, underscores the way the statute has been used to chill security research.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref16_w1dwo1s" title="John Borland, &quot;Court Blocks Security Conference Talk,&quot; CNET News, April 14, 2003." href="#footnote16_w1dwo1s">16</a></p>
<p><b>Xbox Hack Book Dropped by Publisher</b>&#13;</p>
<p>In 2003, U.S. publisher John Wiley &amp; Sons dropped plans to publish a book by security researcher Andrew "Bunnie" Huang, citing DMCA liability concerns. Wiley had commissioned Huang to write a book that described the security flaws in the Microsoft Xbox game console, flaws Huang had discovered as part of his doctoral research at M.I.T.&#13;</p>
<p>Following Microsoft's legal action against a vendor of Xbox "mod chips" in early 2003, and the music industry's 2001 DMCA threats against Professor Felten's research team, Wiley dropped the book for fear that the book might be treated as a "circumvention device" under the DMCA. Huang's initial attempt to self-publish was thwarted after his online shopping cart provider also withdrew, citing DMCA concerns.&#13;</p>
<p>After several months of negotiations, Huang eventually self-published the book in mid-2003. After extensive legal consultations, Huang was able to get the book published by No Starch Press.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref17_1nhxn9t" title="David Becker, &quot;Testing Microsoft and the DMCA,&quot; CNET News, April 15, 2003; Seth Schiesel, &quot;Behind a Hacker's Book, a Primer on Copyright Law,&quot; N.Y. Times, July 10, 2003." href="#footnote17_1nhxn9t">17</a></p>
<p><b>Censorware Research Obstructed</b>&#13;</p>
<p>Seth Finkelstein conducts research on "censorware" software (i.e., programs that block websites that contain objectionable material), documenting flaws in such software. Finkelstein's research, for example, revealed that censorware vendor N2H2 blocked a variety of legitimate websites, evidence that assisted the ACLU in challenging a law requiring the use web filtering software by federally-funded public libraries.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref18_zhdxgq1" title="Mainstream Loudoun v. Board of Trustees, 24 F.Supp.2d 552 (E.D. Va. 1998)." href="#footnote18_zhdxgq1">18</a></p>
<p>N2H2 claimed that the DMCA should block researchers like Finkelstein from examining its software. Finkelstein was ultimately forced to seek a DMCA exemption from the Librarian of Congress, who granted the exemption in both the 2000 and 2003 triennial rulemakings. The exemption, however, was not renewed in 2006, leaving future researchers without protection from DMCA threats.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref19_htq2eew" title="Jennifer 8 Lee, &quot;Cracking the Code of Online Censorship&quot;, N. Y. TIMES, July 19, 2001 http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/19/technology/circuits/19HACK.html; Transcript of Hearing in Copyright Office Rulemaking Proceeding RM 2002-04, April 11, 2003, pages 11, 31" href="#footnote19_htq2eew">19</a></p>
<p>Benjamin Edelman has also conducted extensive research into flaws in various censorware products. Edelman's research also led to evidence used by the ACLU in its constitutional challenge to the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), which mandates the use of censorware by public libraries.&#13;</p>
<p>In the course of his work for the ACLU, Edelman discovered that the DMCA might interfere with his efforts to learn what websites are blocked by censorware products. Because he sought to create and distribute software tools to enable others to analyze the list if it changed, Edelman could not rely on the limited DMCA regulatory exception in place at the time. Unwilling to risk civil and criminal penalties under Section 1201, Edelman was forced to sue to seek clarification of his legal rights. Unfortunately, the court found that Edelman would have to undertake the research and hazard legal reprisals in order to have standing to challenge the DMCA. The case was therefore dismissed without addressing the DMCA's chill on research.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref20_omb9kwk" title="ACLU, &quot;In Legal First, ACLU Sues Over New Copyright Law&quot;http://www.aclu.org/privacy/speech/15201res20020725.html." href="#footnote20_omb9kwk">20</a></p>
<p><b>Dmitry Sklyarov Arrested</b>&#13;</p>
<p>In July 2001, Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov was jailed for several weeks and detained for five months in the United States after speaking at the DEFCON conference in Las Vegas.&#13;</p>
<p>Prosecutors, prompted by software goliath Adobe Systems Inc., alleged that Sklyarov had worked on a software program known as the Advanced e-Book Processor, which was distributed over the Internet by his Russian employer, ElcomSoft. The software allowed owners of Adobe electronic books ("e-books") to convert them from Adobe's e-Book format into PDF files, thereby removing restrictions embedded into the files by e-book publishers.&#13;</p>
<p>Sklyarov was never accused of infringing any copyright, nor of assisting anyone else to infringe copyrights. His alleged crime was working on a software tool with many legitimate uses, simply because other people <i>might</i> use the tool to copy an e-book without the publisher's permission.&#13;</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors ultimately permitted Sklyarov to return home, but brought criminal charges against ElcomSoft. In December 2002, a jury acquitted Elcomsoft of all charges, completing an 18-month ordeal for the wrongly-accused Russian software company.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref21_3d5a2fr" title="Lawrence Lessig, &quot;Jail Time in the Digital Age,&quot; N.Y. Times, July 30, 2001, page A7; Lisa Bowman, &quot;Elcomsoft Verdict: Not Guilty,&quot; CNET News, Dec. 17, 2002." href="#footnote21_3d5a2fr">21</a></p>
<p><b>Scientists and Programmers Withhold Research</b>&#13;</p>
<p>Following the Felten and Sklyarov incidents, a number of prominent computer security experts curtailed their legitimate research activities for fear of potential DMCA liability.&#13;</p>
<p>For example, when Dutch cryptographer and security systems analyst Niels Ferguson discovered a major security flaw in Intel's HDCP video encryption system, he declined to publish his results on his website on the grounds that he travels frequently to the U.S. and is fearful of "prosecution and/or liability under the U.S. DMCA law."<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref22_44l9opi" title="Niels Ferguson, &quot;Censorship in Action: Why I Don't Publish My HDCP Results,&quot; Aug. 15, 2001; Niels Ferguson, Declaration in Felten &amp; Ors v R.I.A.A. case, Aug. 13, 2001; Lisa M. Bowman, &quot;Researchers Weigh Publication, Prosecution,&quot; CNET News, Aug. 15, 2001." href="#footnote22_44l9opi">22</a></p>
<p>Following the arrest of Dmitry Sklyarov, Fred Cohen, a professor of digital forensics and respected security consultant, removed his "Forensix" evidence-gathering software from his website, citing fear of potential DMCA liability. Another respected network security protection expert, Dug Song, also removed information from his website for the same reason. Mr. Song is the author of several security papers, including a paper describing a common vulnerability in many firewalls.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref23_3n7gxdc" title="Robert Lemos, &quot;Security Workers: Copyright Law Stifles,&quot; CNET News, Sept. 6, 2001." href="#footnote23_3n7gxdc">23</a></p>
<p>In mid-2001 an anonymous programmer discovered a vulnerability in Microsoft's proprietary e-book DRM system, but refused to publish the results, citing DMCA liability concerns.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref24_4u67wll" title="Wade Roush, &quot;Breaking Microsoft's e-Book Code,&quot; Technology Review, November 2001, page 24." href="#footnote24_4u67wll">24</a></p>
<p><b>Foreign Scientists Avoid U.S.</b>&#13;</p>
<p>Foreign scientists have expressed concerns about traveling to the U.S. following the arrest of Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov. Some foreign scientists have advocated boycotting conferences held in the United States, and some conference organizers have decided to hold events in non-U.S. locations. In 2001, Russia went so far as to issue a travel advisory to Russian programmers traveling to the United States.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref25_297t9yq" title="Jennifer 8 Lee, &quot;Travel Advisory for Russian Programmers,&quot; N.Y.

<p>Highly respected British Linux programmer Alan Cox resigned from the USENIX committee of the Advanced Computing Systems Association, the committee that organizes many of the U.S. computing conferences, because of concerns about traveling to the United States.

<p><b>IEEE Wrestles with DMCA</b>&#13;</p>
<p>The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), which publishes 30 per cent of all computer science journals worldwide, has also grappled with the uncertainties created by the DMCA. Apparently concerned about possible DMCA liability, the IEEE in November 2001 instituted a policy requiring all authors to indemnify IEEE for any liabilities incurred should a submission result in legal action.&#13;</p>
<p>After an outcry from IEEE members, the organization ultimately revised its submission policies, removing mention of the DMCA. According to Bill Hagen, manager of IEEE Intellectual Property Rights, "The Digital Millennium Copyright Act has become a very sensitive subject among our authors. It's intended to protect digital content, but its application in some specific cases appears to have alienated large segments of the research community."<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref28_bnld5ej" title="IEEE press release, &quot;IEEE to Revise New Copyright Form to Address Author Concerns,&quot; April 22, 2002; Will Knight, &quot;Controversial Copyright Clause Abandoned,&quot; New Scientist, April 15, 2002." href="#footnote28_bnld5ej">28</a></p>
<p><b><i>2600</i> Magazine Censored</b>&#13;</p>
<p>The <i>Universal City Studios v. Reimerdes</i> case illustrates the chilling effect that section 1201 has had on the freedom of the press.&#13;</p>
<p>In that case, eight major motion picture companies brought DMCA claims against <i>2600</i> Magazine seeking to block it from publishing DeCSS, a software program that defeats the CSS encryption used on DVD movies. <i>2600</i> had made the program available on its web site in the course of its ongoing coverage of the controversy surrounding the DMCA. The magazine was not involved in the development of software, nor was it accused of having used the software for any copyright infringement.&#13;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the First Amendment's guarantee of a free press, the district court permanently barred 2600 from publishing, or even linking to, the DeCSS software code. In November 2001, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court decision.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref29_68c9msm" title="Universal City Studios v. Reimerdes, 111 F.

<p>In essence, the movie studios effectively obtained a "stop the presses" order banning the publication of truthful information by a news publication concerning a matter of public concern—an unprecedented curtailment of well-established First Amendment principles.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref30_6n52w37" title="Carl S.

<p><b>CNET Reporter Feels Chill</b>&#13;</p>
<p>CNET News reporter Declan McCullagh confronted the chilling effect of the DMCA firsthand. While research a story in 2002, he found four documents on the public website of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA). The website disclosed that the documents contained information about airport security procedures, the relationship between federal and local police, and a "liability information sheet." A note on the site stated that this "information is restricted to airport management and local law enforcement." The documents were distributed in encrypted form and a password was required to open and read them.&#13;</p>
<p>McCullagh obtained the passwords from an anonymous source, but did not open the documents, citing concerns that using a password without authorization might violate the DMCA.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref31_yzq3s5i" title="Subsequent cases have found that using a password in similar circumstances does not violate the DMCA's circumvention ban.

<p><b>Texas Instruments Targets Calculator Hobbyists</b>&#13;</p>
<p>In 2009, Texas Instruments (TI) threatened three bloggers with legal action after they posted commentary about a hobbyist's success in reverse engineering the TI-83 Plus graphing calculator.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref33_mp3ue0r" title="Dan Goodin, &quot;Texas Instruments Aims Lawyers at Calculator Hackers,&quot; The Register, Sept. 23, 2009 http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/09/23/texas_instruments_calculator_hacking/." href="#footnote33_mp3ue0r">33</a> TI's graphing calculators contain technical measures that prevent users from installing alternative operating systems. When a hobbyist reverse engineered this system in order to help others run their own "home brew" operating systems, he wrote about it online. Three bloggers (Brandon Wilson, Tom Cross and Duncan Smith) subsequently posted their own commentary on the results.&#13;</p>
<p>TI sent the bloggers letters threatening legal action under the DMCA. This despite the fact that there was no hint of "piracy" in the blogger's activities; in fact, TI made the TI-83 Plus software freely available in unencrypted format both online and in the calculators themselves.&#13;</p>
<p>Although the bloggers initially complied with TI's demands and removed the content, they subsequently reposted it after EFF responded to TI on their behalf.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref34_7y4y570" title="Letter from EFF to Texas Instruments, Oct. 13, 2009 http://www.eff.org/files/filenode/coders/TI%20Claim%20Ltr%20101309.pdf." href="#footnote34_7y4y570">34</a></p>
<p><b>Microsoft Threatens Slashdot</b>&#13;</p>
<p>In spring 2000, Microsoft invoked the DMCA against the Internet publication forum Slashdot, demanding that forum moderators delete materials relating to Microsoft's proprietary implementation of an open security standard known as Kerberos.&#13;</p>
<p>In the Slashdot forum, several individuals alleged that Microsoft had changed the open, non-proprietary Kerberos specification in order to prevent non-Microsoft servers from interacting with Windows 2000. Many speculated that this move was intended to force users to purchase Microsoft server software. Although Microsoft responded to this criticism by publishing its Kerberos specification, it conditioned access to the specification on agreement to a "click-wrap" license agreement that expressly forbade disclosure of the specification without Microsoft's prior consent.&#13;</p>
<p>Slashdot posters responded by republishing the Microsoft specification. Microsoft then invoked the DMCA, demanding that Slashdot remove the republished specifications.&#13;</p>
<p>In the words of Georgetown law professor Julie Cohen, "If Microsoft's interpretation of the DMCA's ban on circumvention technologies is right, then it doesn't seem to matter much whether posting unauthorized copies of the Microsoft Kerberos specification would be a fair use. A publisher can prohibit fair-use commentary simply by implementing access and disclosure restrictions that bind the entire public.

<p><b>GameSpy Menaces Security Researcher with DMCA</b>&#13;</p>
<p>Luigi Auriemma, an independent Italian security researcher, attracted the attention of GameSpy's lawyers after publishing details on his website regarding security vulnerabilities in GameSpy's online services, including a voice chat program, Roger Wilco, and online game finder, GameSpy 3D. Before publishing the information, Auriemma had informed GameSpy and public security mailing lists of the weaknesses. GameSpy, however, had failed to address the vulnerabilities.&#13;</p>
<p>In November 2003, GameSpy's lawyers sent a cease and desist letter to Auriemma, threatening civil and criminal penalties under the DMCA. According to GameSpy, Auriemma was publishing key generators and other piracy tools, rather than simply vulnerability research. Whatever the merits of GameSpy's claims, the invocation of the DMCA was likely improper in light of the fact that Auriemma resides in Italy and thus is beyond the reach of the DMCA.<br /><a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref36_u9qlw3y" title="Robert Lemos, &quot;GameSpy Warns Security Researcher,&quot; ZDNet News, Nov. 13, 2003." href="#footnote36_u9qlw3y">36</a></p>

As the webmaster for the site noted, even though information on bypassing the copy protection was readily available on the Internet at the time, republishing user hints on work-arounds risked attracting a DMCA lawsuit and harsh penalties.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref38_7dxcgti" title="Regarding hints on evading iTunes Store copy protection, May 7, 2003." href="#footnote38_7dxcgti">38</a></p>
<h2>Fair Use Under Siege</h2>
<p>"Fair use" is a crucial element in American copyright law—the principle that the public is entitled, without having to ask permission, to use copyrighted works in ways that do not unduly interfere with the copyright owner's market for a work. Fair uses include personal, noncommercial uses, such as using a VCR to record a television program for later viewing. Fair use also includes activities undertaken for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship or research.&#13;</p>
<p>We are entering an era where digital content—including e-books and video—is "copy-protected" and otherwise restricted by technological means. Whether scholars, researchers, commentators and the public will continue to be able to make legitimate fair uses of these works will depend upon the availability of tools to bypass these digital locks.&#13;</p>
<p>The DMCA, however, prohibits the creation or distribution of these tools, even if they are crucial to fair use. So, as copyright owners use technology to press into the 21st century, the public will see fair uses whittled away by digital locks allegedly intended to "prevent piracy." Perhaps more importantly, <b>future fair uses may not be developed</b> for restricted media, because courts will never have the opportunity to rule on them. Fair users will be found liable for "picking the lock" and thereby violating the DMCA, whatever the merits of their fair use defense.&#13;</p>
<p>Copyright owners argue that these tools, in the hands of copyright infringers, can result in "Internet piracy." But banning the tools that enable fair use will punish the innocent along with infringers. Photocopiers, VCRs, and CD-R burners can also be misused, but no one would suggest that the public give them up simply because they might be used by others to break the law.&#13;</p>
<p>Although the Copyright Office is empowered to grant limited DMCA exemptions in a triennial rule-making, it has repeatedly refused to grant exemptions for consumer fair uses.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref39_l7zuian" title="EFF, DMCA Triennial Rulemaking: Failing the Digital Consumer, Dec. 1, 2005." href="#footnote39_l7zuian">39</a></p>
<p><b>Copy-protected CDs &amp; DRM in Online Music</b>&#13;</p>
<p>"Copy-protected" CDs and digital rights management (DRM) for online music illustrate the collision between fair use and the DMCA in the music world. Although major labels abandoned CD copy-protection after the Sony-BMG "rootkit" scandal in late-2005, more than 15 million copy-protected CDs were distributed.&#13;</p>
<p>Such CD copy-protection technologies interfered with the fair use expectations of music fans by inhibiting the transfer of music from CD to iPods or other MP3 players—despite the fact that making an MP3 copy of a CD for personal use qualifies as a fair use. Other fair uses impaired by copy-protection technologies include making "mix CDs" or making copies of a CD for the office or car. Unfortunately, companies that distribute tools to "repair" these dysfunctional CDs, restoring to consumers their fair use privileges, run the risk of lawsuits under the DMCA's ban on circumvention tools and technologies.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref40_hn1prhu" title="Rep.

<p><b>Fair Use Tools Banned: DVD Software</b>&#13;</p>
<p>There are many legitimate reasons to copy DVDs. Once the video is on the PC, for example, lots of fair uses become possible—for example, video creators can remix movie clips into original YouTube videos, frequent travelers can load the movie into their laptops, and DVD owners can skip the otherwise "unskippable" commercials that preface certain films. Without the tools necessary to copy DVDs, however, these fair uses become more difficult or impossible.&#13;</p>
<p>DMCA lawsuits targeting makers of DVD copying tools have hampered these and other fair uses of DVDs. In the <i>Universal v. Reimerdes</i> case, discussed above, the court held that the DMCA bans DeCSS, the first of many widely available free tools for decrypting and copying DVDs. In another case, federal courts ordered 321 Studios' DVD X Copy product taken off the shelves for violating the DMCA. Major movie studios also used the DMCA to sue Tritton Technologies, the manufacturer of DVD CopyWare, and three website distributors of similar software.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref43_6w1r1s6" title="Matthew Mirapaul, &quot;They'll Always Have Paris (and the Web),&quot; N.Y.

<p>In October 2008, RealNetworks was forced to stop sales of its RealDVD software, designed to allow users to copy a DVD and store it on their hard drive. This format-shifting by RealDVD would have enabled DVD owners to create backups, organize a movie collection digitally, and watch a DVD at any time without being tied to a physical disc. Nor did RealDVD represent a "piracy" threat: RealDVD preserved the DVD's CSS copy-protection system and added numerous additional security measures. RealNetworks also took a license from the DVD Copy Control Association to perform the necessary DVD decryption. Nevertheless, a federal court ruled in August 2009 that, even if the uses enabled by RealDVD were lawful fair uses, the DMCA forbids the distribution of tools like RealDVD.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref44_oqx4p9a" title="Real Networks, Inc. v. DVD Copy Control Ass'n, 641 F. Supp. 2d 913, 942 (N.D. Cal. 2009). " href="#footnote44_oqx4p9a">44</a></p>
<p>In light of these rulings, movie fans, film scholars, movie critics, educators, librarians, video remixers, and public interest groups have been forced to ask the Copyright Office repeatedly for DMCA exemptions to allow the decryption of DVDs in order to enable noninfringing uses. For example, exemptions have been sought to allow movie critics to post movie clips, DVD owners to skip "unskippable" previews and commercials, and legitimate purchasers to bypass "region coding" restrictions on their DVD players. Every DVD-related request was denied in both the 2000 and 2003 triennial rulemakings.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref45_7w4f9k9" title="Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights in RM 2002-4, Oct. 27, 2003, pages 109-26 http://www.copyright.gov/1201/docs/registers-recommendation.pdf." href="#footnote45_7w4f9k9">45</a> In 2006, a narrow DMCA exemption was granted to allow film professors to create compilations of motion pictures for educational use in the classroom.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref46_oixazl6" title="Statement of the Librarian of Congress Relating to Section 1201 Rulemaking, Nov. 27, 2006 http://www.copyright.gov/1201/docs/2006_statement.html." href="#footnote46_oixazl6">46</a></p>
<p>In 2009, educators renewed their request for an exemption that would allow film professors, media studies educators, and students to use short clips taken from DVDs for educational purposes.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref47_4srig7y" title="Comments of Renee Hobbs, Peter Decherney, Library Copyright Alliance http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2008/index.html." href="#footnote47_4srig7y">47</a> EFF and the Organization for Transformative Works also applied for an exemption to allow remixers to extract clips from DVDs to create noncommercial remix videos.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref48_pfmql8q" title="Comments of EFF and OTW http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2008/comments/lohmann-fred.pdf." href="#footnote48_pfmql8q">48</a> While the motion picture industry endorsed a renewal of the narrow exemption for film professors, it opposed any expansion to permit other noninfringing uses of DVDs, going so far as to suggest that noninfringing users should camcord DVD clips from flat screen televisions.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref49_m9xz0eu" title="Jacqui Cheng, &quot;MPAA: Teachers Should Videotape Monitors, Not Rip DVDS,&quot; Ars Technica, May 7, 2009 http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/05/mpaa-teachers-should-video-record-tv-screens-not-rip-dvds.ars." href="#footnote49_m9xz0eu">49</a> As of February 2010, the Copyright Office had not yet ruled on the 2009 exemption proposals.&#13;</p>
<p>Even if other narrow exemptions are granted in the future, it is worth noting that the Copyright Office is powerless to grant an exemption to the DMCA's "tools" ban. As a result, even if fair users succeed in obtaining a DMCA exemption, technology companies will remain reluctant to supply them with the necessary circumvention tools.&#13;</p>
<p><b>Advanced e-Book Processor and e-Books</b>&#13;</p>
<p>The future of fair use for books was at issue in the criminal prosecution of Dmitry Sklyarov and Elcomsoft. As discussed above, Elcomsoft produced and distributed a tool called the Advanced e-Book Processor, which translates e-books from Adobe's e-book format to PDF. This translation process removed various restrictions (against copying, printing, text-to-speech processing, etc.) that publishers can impose on e-books.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref50_9mlul7m" title="EFF, Frequently Asked Questions re U.S. v. Sklyarov." href="#footnote50_9mlul7m">50</a></p>
<p>The Advanced e-Book Processor allowed those who have legitimately purchased e-books to make fair uses of their e-books, uses otherwise made impossible by the restrictions of the Adobe e-book format. For instance, the program allowed people to engage in the following fair uses:&#13;</p>
<ul>
<li>read the e-book on a laptop or computer other than the one on which it was first downloaded;</li>
<li>continue to access the e-book in the future, if the particular technological device for which it was purchased becomes obsolete;</li>
<li>print an e-book on paper;</li>
<li>read an e-book on an alternative operating system such as Linux (Adobe's format works only on Macs and Windows PCs);</li>
<li>have a computer read an e-book out loud using text-to-speech software, which is particularly important for visually-impaired individuals.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Time-shifting and Streaming Media</b>&#13;</p>
<p>As more people receive audio and video content from "streaming" Internet media sources, they will want tools to preserve their settled fair use expectations, including the ability to "time-shift" programming for later listening or viewing. As a result of the DMCA, however, the digital equivalents of VCRs and cassette decks for streaming media may never arrive.&#13;</p>
<p>Start-up software company Streambox developed exactly such a product, known simply as the Streambox VCR, designed to time-shift streaming media. When RealNetworks discovered that the Streambox VCR could time-shift streaming RealAudio webcasts, it invoked the DMCA and obtained an injunction against the Streambox VCR product (years later, this ruling would come to haunt RealNetworks when it found itself the target of a DMCA lawsuit over its own RealDVD software, as described above).<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref51_t527thq" title="RealNetworks, Inc. v. Streambox, Inc., No. C99-2070P, 2000 WL 127311 (W.D. Wash. Jan. 18, 2000)." href="#footnote51_t527thq">51</a></p>
<p>The DMCA has also been invoked to threaten the developer of an open source, noncommercial software application known as Streamripper that records MP3 audio streams for later listening.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref52_ewcqsep" title="Cease and desist letter from Kenneth Plevan on behalf of Live365.com to John Clegg, developer of Streamripper, April 26, 2001." href="#footnote52_ewcqsep">52</a></p>
<p><b>Agfa Monotype and Fonts</b>&#13;</p>
<p>In January 2002, typeface vendor Agfa Monotype Corporation threatened a college student with DMCA liability for creating "embed," a free, open source, noncommercial software program designed to manipulate TrueType fonts.&#13;</p>
<p>According to the student: "I wrote embed in 1997, after discovering that all of my fonts disallowed embedding in documents. Since my fonts are free, this was silly—but I didn't want to take the time to… change the flag, and then reset all of the extended font properties with a separate program. What a bore! Instead, I wrote this program to convert all of my fonts at once. The program is very simple; it just requires setting a few bits to zero. Indeed, I noticed that other fonts that were licensed for unlimited distribution also disallowed embedding…. So, I put this program on the web in hopes that it would help other font developers as well."&#13;</p>
<p>Agfa Monotype nevertheless threatened the student author with DMCA liability for distributing the program. According to Agfa, the fact that embed can be used to allow distribution of protected fonts made it contraband under section 1201, notwithstanding the fact that the tool had many legitimate uses in the hands of hobbyist font developers.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref53_1r3zk8b" title="Tom Murphy, &quot;embed: DMCA Threats&quot; http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/~twm/embed/dmca.html; cease and desist letter from Agfa to Murphy http://www.chillingeffects.org/copyright/notice.cgi?NoticeID=264." href="#footnote53_1r3zk8b">53</a></p>
<p>Agfa Monotype brought similar DMCA challenges against Adobe Systems for its Acrobat 5.0's FreeText Tool and Forms Tool, which allowed so-called "editable embedding." Agfa claimed that with Acrobat 5.0, the recipient of an electronic document could make use of embedded fonts to change the contents of a form field or free text annotation, thus "circumventing" the embedding bits of some of Agfa's TrueType Fonts.&#13;</p>
<p>Fortunately, in 2005, a federal court found that Adobe had not violated either section 1201(a) or section 1201(b) of the DMCA. The court noted that embedding bits do not effectively control access to a protected work and, moreover, that Acrobat 5.0 was not designed primarily to circumvent TrueType fonts.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref54_p1oboy9" title="See Agfa Monotype Corp. v. Adobe Sys., 404 F. Supp. 2d 1030 (N.D. Ill. 2005)." href="#footnote54_p1oboy9">54</a></p>
<p><b>Load-'N-Go Space-shifting</b>&#13;</p>
<p>In November 2006, movie studios used the DMCA against Load-'N-Go, a small company that loaded DVDs purchased by a customer onto the customer's iPod. Load-'N-Go would take DVDs purchased by the customer, load them onto her iPod, and then return both the iPod and the original DVDs.&#13;</p>
<p>The movie studios claimed this service violated the DMCA because creating a duplicate copy of the movie—even for personal, fair uses—circumvents the DVD's CSS encryption. Under this theory, any individual attempting to space-shift movies from DVD to iPod or to any other digital media player is violating the DMCA.

<h2>A threat to innovation and competition</h2>
<p>The DMCA has frequently been used to deter legitimate innovation and competition, rather than to stop piracy.&#13;</p>
<p>For example, the DMCA has been used to block aftermarket competition in laser printer toner cartridges, garage door openers, and computer maintenance services. Apple relies on the DMCA to lock iPhone owners into purchasing software exclusively from Apple's own iTunes App Store. Videogame hobbyists have been sued for trying to improve or extend the capabilities of their favorite game titles. Sony has threatened hobbyists for creating software that enables Sony's Aibo robot dog to dance, and has sued to block software that allows gamers to play their PlayStation games on PCs.&#13;</p>
<p>In each of these cases, it was legitimate competitors and innovators who suffered, not pirates.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref56_9b2rp7h" title="Others have also recognized the anti-competitive effects of the DMCA.

<p><b>Apple Uses DMCA to Lock iPhone to App Store</b>&#13;</p>
<p>Apple uses technical measures backed by the DMCA to lock iPhone owners into obtaining software ("apps") exclusively from Apple's own iTunes App Store, where every app must be approved by Apple and Apple retains 30% of revenues generated by app sales. Apple also uses the DMCA to prevent iPhone owners from switching to mobile phone carriers of their choice.&#13;</p>
<p>Despite Apple's efforts, millions of iPhone owners, assisted by independent hobbyists, have "unlocked" or "jailbroken" their iPhones to use the carriers and apps of their choice.

<p><b>DMCA Used First to Lock Cell Phones to Carriers; Then, to Hammer Phone Resellers</b>&#13;</p>
<p>American cellular phone subscribers have long suffered with phones that are artificially "locked" to a particular carrier's network. This creates a variety of burdens for consumers, including high roaming rates when traveling (by preventing the use of prepaid SIM chips from local carriers) and barriers to switching carriers. In addition, these restrictions make locked phones harder to recycle and reuse. "Locking" phones seems particularly unjustifiable in light of the "minimum term" and "early termination fee" clauses that guarantee carriers will recoup the costs of the phones they are so fond of "giving away" to lure subscribers.&#13;</p>
<p>Responding to consumer demand, phone "unlocking" services have become widespread. Unfortunately, carriers have responded by filing suit under the DMCA. Instead of being used against copyright infringers, the DMCA is being used to prop up the anticompetitive business models of cellular carriers.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref62_0l51m5t" title="Jennifer Granick, &quot;Free the Cell Phone!,&quot; WIRED News, Sept. 30, 2005; Reply Comments of the Wireless Alliance, Copyright Office, Docket No. RM-2005-11." href="#footnote62_0l51m5t">62</a></p>
<p>At the 2006 triennial DMCA rulemaking, the Copyright Office granted an exemption for cell phone unlocking. Despite this exemption, however, DMCA lawsuits persist. Tracfone, the nation's largest independent prepaid-wireless provider, aggressively uses the DMCA to sue phone resellers who purchase and unlock Tracfone handsets.

Until Harmony, the only DRM-restricted music format playable on the iPod was Apple's own "Fairplay" format. Although the iPod plays a variety of DRM-free formats, Real wanted to ensure interoperability without having to give up DRM restrictions, and thus developed Harmony to "re-wrap" its songs using the Fairplay format.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref67_r652w1w" title="Real has since abandoned DRM for its music download service.

<p>Enthusiastic fans of the videogames Ninja Gaiden, Dead or Alive 3, and Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball managed to modify their games to create new "skins" to change the appearance of characters who appear in the game (including making some characters appear nude). The modifications were add-on enhancements for the games themselves—only those who already had the games could make use of the skins. These hobbyist tinkerers traded their modding tips and swapped skins on a website called ninjahacker.net.&#13;</p>
<p>Tecmo Inc., which distributes the games, was not amused and brought DMCA claims against the website operators and tinkerers who frequented it.

As a result, these files would not be compatible with Photoshop or other similar software unless the developers first took licenses from Nikon. In other words, by encrypting the image files on its cameras, Nikon was obtaining market leverage in the image editing software market.&#13;</p>

<p>A district court granted a preliminary injunction against Custom Hardware. More than a year later, a court of appeals vacated the injunction, holding that where there is no nexus with copyright infringement, there can be no DMCA claim.

<p>Lexmark, the second-largest laser printer maker in the U.S., has long tried to eliminate the secondary market in refilled laser toner cartridges. In January 2003, Lexmark employed the DMCA as a new weapon in its arsenal.&#13;</p>
<p>Lexmark had added authentication routines between its printers and cartridges explicitly to hinder aftermarket toner vendors. Static Control Components (SCC) reverse-engineered these measures and sold "Smartek" chips that enabled refilled cartridges to work in Lexmark printers. Lexmark then used the DMCA to obtain an injunction banning SCC from selling its chips to cartridge remanufacturers.&#13;</p>

Sony also sued Bleem, the leading vendor of PlayStation emulator software for Windows PCs.&#13;</p>
<p>In both cases, Sony claimed that competitors had violated the DMCA by engaging in unlawful circumvention, even though the development of interoperable software has been recognized by the courts as a fair use under copyright law. Because courts have suggested that the DMCA trumps fair use, however, the DMCA has become a new legal weapon with which to threaten those who rely on reverse engineering to create competing products.&#13;</p>

Sony claimed that the act of circumventing the encryption surrounding the software in the Aibo violated the DMCA and demanded that the hobbyist remove his programs from his website.&#13;</p>
<p>Responding to public outcry, Sony ultimately permitted the hobbyist to repost some of his programs (on the understanding that Sony retained the right to commercially exploit the hobbyist's work).

<p><b>Sony Attacks PlayStation "Mod Chips"</b>&#13;</p>
<p>Sony has sued a number of manufacturers and distributors of "mod chips" for alleged circumvention under the DMCA. In doing so, Sony has been able to enforce a system of "region coding" that raises significant anticompetitive issues.&#13;</p>
<p>"Mod chips" are after-market accessories that modify Sony PlayStation game consoles to permit games legitimately purchased in one part of the world to be played on a games console from another geographical region. Sony complains that mod chips can also be used to play pirated copies of games. As noted above, it is hard to see why an independent vendor of a product with legitimate uses should have to solve Sony's piracy problems before entering the market.&#13;</p>
<p>Sony sued Gamemasters, distributor of the Game Enhancer peripheral device, which allowed owners of a U.S. PlayStation console to play games purchased in Japan and other countries. Although there was no infringement of Sony's copyright, the court granted an injunction under the DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions, effectively leaving gamers at the mercy of Sony's region coding system.&#13;</p>
<p>Interestingly, courts in Australia, recognizing the anticompetitive and anticonsumer potential of Sony's region coding system, came to a different conclusion under that country's analog to the DMCA. In <i>Stevens v Kabushiki Kaisha Sony Computer Entertainment</i>, the High Court of Australia held in 2005 that the regional access coding on Sony PlayStation computer games as implemented by the PlayStation console did not qualify for legal protection, as it did not prevent or inhibit copyright infringement.&#13;</p>
<p>Sony, like all vendors, is free to attempt to segregate geographic markets. If it does so, however, it should have to bear its own costs for the effort, rather than relying on the DMCA, which Congress plainly did not enact to trump the usual legal regimes governing parallel importation. <a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref76_b4a7l83" title="&quot;Sony PlayStation ruling sets far-reaching precedent,&quot; New Scientist, Feb. 22, 2002; Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc. v.

<p><b>Blizzard Sues bnetd.org</b>&#13;</p>
<p>Vivendi-Universal's Blizzard Entertainment video game division brought a DMCA lawsuit against a group of volunteer game enthusiasts who created software that allowed owners of Blizzard games to play their games over the Internet. The software, called "bnetd," allowed gamers to set up their own alternative to Blizzard's own Battle.net service.&#13;</p>
<p>Blizzard has a policy of locking in its customers who want to play their games over the Internet—it's the Battle.net servers or nothing. Although access to Blizzard's Battle.net servers is free, the hobbyists decided to create bnetd to overcome difficulties that they had experienced in attempting to use Battle.net. The bnetd software was freely distributed, open source, and noncommercial.&#13;</p>
<p>Blizzard filed suit in St. Louis to bar distribution of bnetd, alleging that the software was a "circumvention device" prohibited by the DMCA. According to Blizzard, the bnetd software could be used to permit networked play of pirated Blizzard games. The developers never used the software for that purpose, nor was that the purpose for which the software was designed.&#13;</p>
<p>It is hard to see why a competitor should have to solve Blizzard's piracy problem before it can offer innovative products for legitimate owners of Blizzard games.

<p><b>Macrovision Sues Sima for Digitizing Analog Signals</b>&#13;</p>
<p>In April 2006, hardware manufacturer Sima Products was forced to stop selling various video enhancing products that digitized analog signals from DVD players and VCRs. Wielding the DMCA, Macrovision argued that Sima's analog-to-digital video enhancements circumvented Macrovision's analog copy protection (ACP).&#13;</p>
<p>Macrovision's ACP functions by inserting noise into the vertical blanking intervals found in analog video signals. This noise is not displayed on a television set, but it does degrade the recording made by most analog VCRs. Sima's products simply convert the analog signal into a digital signal, which eliminates additional noise in the blanking intervals, and then converts the signal back to analog. This video enhancement allows consumers to harness digital techniques to make up for a weakness in VCR analog technology, a weakness which could come from age or distortion as well as from techniques like Macrovision's.&#13;</p>
<p>ACP does not prevent digital copies. Moreover, when a digital copy is made, Macrovision's ACP does not survive. Accordingly, Sima's products were not "circumventing" anything by performing its analog-to-digital conversion.&#13;</p>
<p>Macrovision, nevertheless, was able to convince the court that Sima had violated the DMCA.

XPEL argued the DMCA was violated because (1) the XPEL website is protected by an end-user license agreement (EULA), (2) American Filter clicked that they agreed to the EULA, and (3) the EULA is a technological measure which effectively controls access to the copyrighted design works on XPEL's website. This was the first case where a "click-thru" EULA has been put forward as an access control protected by the DMCA.&#13;</p>

<h2>DMCA Shoulders Aside Computer Intrusion Statutes.</h2>
<p>The DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions have also threatened to displace "computer intrusion" and "anti-hacking" laws, something that Congress plainly never intended.&#13;</p>
<p>State and federal statutes already protect computer network owners from unauthorized intrusions. These include the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), the Wiretap Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), and a variety of state computer intrusion statutes. These statutes, however, generally require that a plaintiff prove that the intrusion caused some harm. The DMCA, in contrast, contains no financial damage threshold, tempting some to use it in place of the statutes that were designed to address computer intrusion.&#13;</p>
<p>Fortunately, the courts appear to be taking steps to rein in this particular misuse of the DMCA, ruling that the use of authentic usernames and passwords to access computers cannot constitute circumvention, even if done without the authorization of the computer owner.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref83_78jqxf7" title="See Egilman v. Keller &amp; Heckman LLP, 401 F.Supp.2d 105 (D.D.C. 2005); I.M.S. Inquiry Mgt. Systems v. Berkshire Info. Systems, 307 F.Supp.2d 521 (S.D.N.Y. 2004)." href="#footnote83_78jqxf7">83</a> Until more judicial precedents are on the books, however, the improper use of the DMCA as an all-purpose computer intrusion prohibition will continue to muddy the waters for lawyers and professionals.&#13;</p>
<p><b>Disgruntled Company Sues Former Contractor For Unauthorized Network Access</b>&#13;</p>
<p>In April 2003, an automated stock trading company sued a former contract programmer under the DMCA, claiming that his access to the company's computer system over a password-protected virtual private network (VPN) connection was an act of circumvention.&#13;</p>
<p>Pearl Investments had employed the programmer to create a software module for its software system. In order to complete the work remotely, the programmer used a VPN to connect to the company's computers. Although the contractor created a very successful software module for the company, the relationship turned frosty after the company ran into financial difficulties and terminated the contractor's contract.&#13;</p>
<p>The company sued the contractor when it discovered the contractor's VPN connection to the its system, claiming electronic trespass, as well as violations of computer intrusion statutes, the CFAA, and the DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions. Pearl claimed that it had withdrawn the authorization it had previously given to the contractor to access its system through the password-protected VPN and that the VPN connection was therefore unauthorized. The Court rejected the company's electronic trespass and CFAA claims due to lack of evidence of any actual damage done. Even though the second server was not being used by the programmer at the time, and its hard drive had been accidentally wiped, the court agreed with Pearl that the existence of the VPN was a prohibited circumvention of a technological protection measure that controlled access to a system which contained copyrighted software.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref84_w6rfkxh" title="Pearl Investments LLC v. Standard I/O, Inc., 257 F. Supp. 2d 326 (D.Me., Apr. 23, 2003)." href="#footnote84_w6rfkxh">84</a></p>
<p><b>Ticketmaster Sues RMG for Bypassing CAPTCHA</b>&#13;</p>
<p>In April 2007, Ticketmaster sued RMG Technologies under the DMCA for circumventing the Ticketmaster website CAPTCHA ("Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart"), the image with distorted letters and numbers that a customer must type before purchasing a ticket. The website run by RMG Technologies provided tickets to events that were likely to sell out quickly on Ticketmaster. RMG allegedly used software to quickly make bulk purchases of tickets from Ticketmaster, circumventing the limit of four tickets per customer, in order to re-sell the tickets for profit.&#13;</p>
<p>Ticketmaster brought suit under the DMCA, the CFAA, the Copyright Act, breach of contract, and under California's criminal code governing computer crimes. On a motion for preliminary injunction, the court found that Ticketmaster was likely to succeed on its DMCA, Copyright Act, and breach of contract claims; however, Ticketmaster would not have been able to prevail on the CFAA claim. (The court found it did not need to address the claim under California's criminal code.)&#13;</p>
<p>This ruling illustrates how the DMCA has shouldered aside computer intrusion statutes like the CFAA. Because the CFAA requires that Ticketmaster prove it suffered $5,000 in damages during one year, whereas the DMCA contains no financial damage threshold, Ticketmaster was able to succeed under the DMCA while failing under the CFAA.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref85_8809l3a" title="Ticketmaster L.L.C. v. RMG Techs., Inc., 507 F. Supp. 2d 1096, 1113 (C.D. Cal. 2007) (&quot;. . . because [Ticketmaster] has not quantified its harm as required by the statute or even attempted to show what portion of the harm is attributable to [RMG], the Court cannot find that [Ticketmaster] has affirmatively shown that its harm caused by [RMG] exceeds the $ 5,000 minimum. Thus, the CFAA claim does not provide a basis for a preliminary injunction.&quot;)." href="#footnote85_8809l3a">85</a></p>
<p>The DMCA was not intended for this purpose. The DMCA was designed to protect copyrighted works, not ticket vendors. Although the defense made both these arguments,<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref86_t6m7bjw" title="Id. at 1112 (&quot;Defendant's only unique arguments as to the DMCA claim are that CAPTCHA is not a system or a program, but is simply an image, and that CAPTCHA is designed to regulate ticket sales, not to regulate access to a copyrighted work.&quot;)." href="#footnote86_t6m7bjw">86</a> the court nevertheless ruled in favor of Ticketmaster on the DMCA claim.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref87_ode7obh" title="See id.; Randall Stross, &quot;Hannah Montana Tickets on Sale! Oops, They're Gone,&quot; N.Y. Times, Dec. 16, 2007." href="#footnote87_ode7obh">87</a></p>
<p><b>Cable Provider Blocks Cable Digital Filters</b>&#13;</p>
<p>In addition to computer intrusion statutes, the DMCA may also be starting to shoulder aside penal statutes in other industry areas.&#13;</p>
<p>In August 2008, cable provider CoxCom Inc. successfully forced Jon and Amy Chaffee, and their one employee, to stop selling cable digital filters at computer trade shows. These low-frequency digital filters blocked pay per view charges from being sent to cable companies, thus giving users free pay per view. Not surprisingly, the court granted summary judgment against the Chaffees for violation of the Cable Communications Policy Act, a statute specifically enacted to address theft of cable services to protect the economic viability of cable operators and cable programmers. However, the court also ruled that the Chaffees violated the DMCA.&#13;</p>
<p>The DMCA argument is that the Chaffees' low-frequency filters circumvent CoxCom's pay-per-view <i>billing mechanism</i>, allegedly a "technological measure" that controls access to copyrighted works. If a billing mechanism has become a "technological measure" within the meaning of the DMCA—it is troubling to think what else may qualify.<a class="see-footnote" id="footnoteref88_bx7qg8h" title="CoxCom, Inc. v. Chaffee, 536 F.3d 101 (1st Cir. 2008) (affirming CoxCom, Inc. v. Chaffee, No. CA05-107S, 2007 WL 1577708 (D.R.I. May 41, 2007))." href="#footnote88_bx7qg8h">88</a></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Years of experience with the "anti-circumvention" provisions of the DMCA demonstrate that the statute reaches too far, chilling a wide variety of legitimate activities in ways Congress did not intend. As an increasing number of copyright works are wrapped in technological protection measures, it is likely that the DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions will be applied in further unforeseen contexts, hindering the legitimate activities of innovators, researchers, the press, and the public at large.</p>
