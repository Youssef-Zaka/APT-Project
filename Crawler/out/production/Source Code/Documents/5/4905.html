was the language spoken in Rome and in the plain of Latium
in the 6th or 7th century <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span>—the earliest period from which
we have any contemporary record of its existence. But it is
as yet impossible to determine either, on the one hand, whether
the archaic inscription of Praeneste (see below), which is assigned
with great probability to that epoch, represents exactly
the language then spoken in Rome; or, on the other, over how
much larger an area of the Italian peninsula, or even of the lands
to the north and west, the same language may at that date
have extended. In the 5th century <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span> we find its limits within
the peninsula fixed on the north-west and south-west by Etruscan
(see <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps"><a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Etruria" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Etruria">Etruria</a></span>: <i>Language</i>); on the east, south-east, and probably
north and north-east, by Safine (Sabine) dialects (of the <a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Marsi" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Marsi">Marsi</a>,
<a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Paeligni" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Paeligni">Paeligni</a>, <a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Samnites" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Samnites">Samnites</a>, <a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Sabini" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Sabini">Sabini</a> and <a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Picenum" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Picenum">Picenum</a>, <i>qq.v.</i>); but on the
north we have no direct record of Sabine speech, nor of any
non-Latinian tongue nearer than Tuder and Asculum or earlier
than the 4th century <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span> (see <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps"><a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Umbria" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Umbria">Umbria</a></span>, <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps"><a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Iguvium" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Iguvium">Iguvium</a></span>, <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps"><a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Picenum" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Picenum">Picenum</a></span>).
We know however, both from tradition and from the archaeological
data, that the Safine tribes were in the 5th century <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span>
migrating, or at least sending off swarms of their younger folk,
farther and farther southward into the peninsula. Of the
languages they were then displacing we have no explicit record
save in the case of Etruscan in Campania, but it may be reasonably
inferred from the evidence of place-names and tribal names,
combined with that of the Faliscan inscriptions, that before
the Safine invasion some idiom, not remote from Latin, was
spoken by the pre-Etruscan tribes down the length of the west
coast (see <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps"><a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Falisci" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Falisci">Falisci</a></span>; <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps"><a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Volsci" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Volsci">Volsci</a></span>; also <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps"><a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Rome" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Rome">Rome</a></span>: <i>History</i>; <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps"><a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Liguria" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Liguria">Liguria</a></span>;
<span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps"><a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Siculi" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Siculi">Siculi</a></span>).
</p><p>2. <i>Earliest Roman Inscriptions.</i>—At Rome, at all events,
it is clear from the unwavering voice of tradition that Latin
was spoken from the beginning of the city. Of the earliest
Latin inscriptions found in Rome which were known in 1909,
the oldest, the so-called “Forum inscription,” can hardly be referred
with confidence to an earlier century than the 5th; the
later, the well-known <i>Duenos</i> (&#160;=&#160;later Latin <i>bonus</i>) inscription,
certainly belongs to the 4th; both of these are briefly described
below (§§ 40, 41). At this date we have probably the period of
the narrowest extension of Latin; non-Latin idioms were
spoken in Etruria, Umbria, Picenum and in the Marsian and
Volscian hills. But almost directly the area begins to expand
again, and after the war with Pyrrhus the Roman arms had
planted the language of Rome in her military colonies throughout
the peninsula. When we come to the 3rd century <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span> the
Latin inscriptions begin to be more numerous, and in them
(<i>e.g.</i> the oldest epitaphs of the Scipio family) the language is
very little removed from what it was in the time of Plautus.
</p><p>3. <i>The Italic Group of Languages.</i>—For the characteristics
and affinities of the dialects that have just been mentioned, see
the article <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps"><a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Italy" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Italy">Italy</a></span>: <i>Ancient Languages and Peoples</i>, and to the
separate articles on the tribes. Here it is well to point out that
the only one of these languages which is not akin to Latin is
Etruscan; on the other hand, the only one very closely resembling
Latin is Faliscan, which with it forms what we may call the
Latinian dialect of the Italic group of the Indo-European family
of languages. Since, however, we have a far more complete
knowledge of Latin than of any other member of the Italic
group, this is the most convenient place in which to state briefly
the very little tha<del>n</del><ins>t</ins> can be said as yet to have been ascertained
as to the general relations of Italic to its sister groups. Here,
as in many kindred questions, the work of Paul Kretschmer of
Vienna (<i>Einleitung in die Geschichte der griechischen Sprache</i>,
Göttingen, 1896) marked an important epoch in the historical
aspects of linguistic study, as the first scientific attempt to
interpret critically the different kinds of evidence which the
Indo-European languages give us, not in vocabulary merely,
but in phonology, morphology, and especially in their mutual
borrowings, and to combine it with the non-linguistic data of
tradition and archaeology. A certain number of the results so
obtained have met with general acceptance and may be briefly
treated here. It is, however, extremely dangerous to draw
merely from linguistic kinship deductions as to racial identity,
or even as to an original contiguity of habitation. Close resemblances
in any two languages, especially those in their inner
structure (morphology), may be due to identity of race, or to long
neighbourhood in the earliest period of their development; but
they may also be caused by temporary neighbourhood (for a
longer or shorter period), brought about by migrations at a later
epoch (or epochs). A particular change in sound or usage may
spread over a whole chain of dialects and be in the end exhibited
alike by them all, although the time at which it first began was
long after their special and distinctive characteristics had
become clearly marked. For example, the limitation of the
word-accent to the last three syllables of a word in Latin and
Oscan (see below)—a phenomenon which has left deep marks
on all the Romance languages—demonstrably grew up between
the 5th and 2nd centuries <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span>; and it is a permissible conjecture
that it started from the influence of the Greek colonies in Italy
(especially Cumae and Naples), in whose language the same
limitation (although with an accent whose actual character was
probably more largely musical) had been established some
centuries sooner.
</p><p>4. <i>Position of the Italic Group.</i>—The Italic group, then, when
compared with the other seven main “families” of &#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="245" data-page-number="245" data-page-name="Page:EB1911 - Volume 16.djvu/265" data-page-index="265" data-page-quality="4" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_16.djvu/265"><span id="pageindex_265" class="pagenum-inner ws-noexport">&#8203;</span></span></span>Indo-European speech, in respect of their most significant differences,
ranges itself thus:
</p>
<div style="font-size: 92%; line-height: 1.3em">
<p>(i.) <i>Back-palatal and Velar Sounds.</i>—In point of its treatment
of the Indo-European back-palatal and velar sounds, it belongs to
the western or <i>centum</i> group, the name of which is, of course, taken
from Latin; that is to say, like German, Celtic and Greek, it did not
sibilate original <i>k</i> and <i>g</i>, which in Indo-Iranian, Armenian, Slavonic
and Albanian have been converted into various types of sibilants
(Ind.-Eur.* <i>km̥tom</i> = Lat. <i>centum</i>, Gr. <span title="(he)-katón"><style data-mw-deduplicate="TemplateStyles:r12033801">.mw-parser-output .wst-lang-grc{font-family:GentiumPlus;font-feature-settings:"cv78"on,"cv83"on}</style><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">(ἑ)-κατόν</span></span>, Welsh <i>cant</i>, Eng.
<i>hund</i>-(<i>red</i>), but Sans. <i>ṧatam</i>, Zend <i>satəm</i>); but, on the other hand, in
company with just the same three western groups, and in contrast to
the eastern, the Italic languages labialized the original velars (Ind.-Eur.
* <i>qod</i> = Lat. <i>quod</i>, Osc. <i>pod</i>, Gr. <span title="pod-(após)"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ποδ-(απός)</span></span>, Welsh <i>pwy</i>, Eng.
<i>what</i>, but Sans. <i>kás</i>, “who?”).
</p><p>(ii.) <i>Indo-European Aspirates.</i>—Like Greek and Sanskrit, but
in contrast to all the other groups (even to Zend and Armenian), the
Italic group largely preserves a distinction between the Indo-European
<i>mediae aspiratae</i> and <i>mediae</i> (<i>e.g.</i> between Ind.-Eur. <i>dh</i>
and <i>d</i>, the former when initial becoming initially regularly Lat. <i>f</i> as
in Lat. <i>fēc-ī</i> [cf. Umb. <i>feia</i>, “<i>faciat</i>”], beside Gr. <span title="é-thēk-a"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ἔ-θηκ-α</span></span> [cf. Sans.
<i>da-dhā-ti</i>, “he places”], the latter simply <i>d</i> as in <i>domus</i>, Gr. <span title="dómos"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">δόμος</span></span>).
But the <i>aspiratae</i>, even where thus distinctly treated in Italic,
became fricatives, not pure aspirates, a character which they only
retained in Greek and Sanskrit.
</p><p>(iii.) <i>Indo-European ŏ.</i>—With Greek and Celtic, Latin preserved
the Indo-European <i>ŏ</i>, which in the more northerly groups (Germanic,
Balto-Slavonic), and also in Indo-Iranian, and, curiously, in
Messapian, was confused with <i>ă</i>. The name for olive-oil, which spread
with the use of this commodity from Greek (<span title="élaiwon"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ἔλαιϝον</span></span>) to Italic
speakers and thence to the north, becoming by regular changes (see
below) in Latin first *<i>ólaivom</i>, then *<i>óleivom</i>, and then taken into
Gothic and becoming <i>alēv</i>, leaving its parent form to change further
(not later than 100 <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span>) in Latin to <i>oleum</i>, is a particularly important
example, because (<i>a</i>) of the chronological limits which are implied,
however roughly, in the process just described, and (<i>b</i>) of the close
association in time of the change of <i>o</i> to <i>a</i> with the earlier stages of
the “sound-shifting” (of the Indo-European plosives and aspirates)
in German; see Kretschmer, <i>Einleit</i>. p. 116, and the authorities he
cites.
</p><p>(iv.) <i>Accentuation.</i>—One marked innovation common to the
western groups as compared with what Greek and Sanskrit show
to have been an earlier feature of the Indo-European parent speech
was the development of a strong expiratory (sometimes called stress)
accent upon the first syllable of all words. This appears early in the
history of Italic, Celtic, Lettish (probably, and at a still later period)
in Germanic, though at a period later than the beginning of the
“sound-shifting.” This extinguished the complex system of
Indo-European accentuation, which is directly reflected in Sanskrit, and
was itself replaced in Latin and Oscan by another system already
mentioned, but not in Latin till it had produced marked effects upon
the language (<i>e.g.</i> the degradation of the vowels in compounds as in
<i>cōnficio</i> from <i>cón-facio</i>, <i>inclūdo</i> from <i>ín-claudo</i>). This curious wave
of accentual change (first pointed out by Dieterich, <i>Kuhn’s Zeitschrift</i>,
i., and later by Thurneysen, <i>Revue celtique</i>, vi. 312, <i>Rheinisches</i>
<i>Museum</i>, xliii. 349) needs and deserves to be more closely investigated
from a chronological standpoint. At present it is not clear how
far it was a really connected process in all the languages. (See
further Kretschmer, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 115, K. Brugmann, <i>Kurze vergleichende</i>
<i>Grammatik</i> (1902–1904), p. 57, and their citations, especially
Meyer-Lübke, <i>Die Betonung im Gallischen</i> (1901).)
</p>
</div>
<p>To these larger affinities may be added some important
points in which the Italic group shows marked resemblances to
other groups.
</p><p>5. <i>Italic and Celtic.</i>—It is now universally admitted that the
Celtic languages stand in a much closer relation than any other
group to the Italic. It may even be doubted whether there was
any real frontier-line at all between the two groups before
the Etruscan invasion of Italy (see <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps"><a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Etruria" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Etruria">Etruria</a></span>: <i>Language</i>;
<span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps"><a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Liguria" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Liguria">Liguria</a></span>). The number of morphological innovations on the
Indo-European system which the two groups share, and which
are almost if not wholly peculiar to them, is particularly striking.
Of these the chief are the following.
</p>
<div style="font-size: 92%; line-height: 1.3em">
<p>(i.) Extension of the abstract-noun stems in -<i>ti</i>- (like Greek <span title="phátis"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">φάτις</span></span>
with Attic <span title="básis"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">βάσις</span></span>, &amp;c.) by an -<i>n</i>- suffix, as in Lat. <i>mentio</i> (stem <i>menti</i>-<i>ōn</i>-)
= Ir. (<i>er</i>-)<i>mitiu</i> (stem <i>miti-n</i>-), contrasted with the same word
without the <i>n</i>-suffix in Sans. <i>mati</i>-, Lat. <i>mens</i>, Ind.-Eur. *<i>mn̥-ti</i>-. A
similar extension (shared also by Gothic) appears in Lat. <i>iuventū-t</i>-,
O. Ir. <i>óitiu</i> (stem <i>oiliūt</i>-) beside the simple -<i>tu</i>- in nouns like <i>senātus</i>.
</p><p>(ii.) Superlative formation in -<i>is-m̥mo</i>- as in Lat. <i>aegerrimus</i> for
*<i>aegr-ism̥mos</i>, Gallic <span title="Ouxisámē"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">Οὐξισάμη</span></span> the name of a town meaning “the
highest.”
</p><p>(iii.) Genitive singular of the <i>o</i>-stems (second declension) in -<i>ī</i>
Lat. <i>agri</i>, O. Ir. (Ogam inscriptions) <i>magi</i>, “of a son.”
</p><p>(iv.) Passive and deponent formation in -<i>r</i>, Lat. <i>sequitur</i> = Ir.
<i>sechedar</i>, “he follows.” The originally active meaning of this curious
-<i>r</i> suffix was first pointed out by Zimmer (<i>Kuhn’s Zeitschrift</i>, 1888,
xxx. 224), who thus explained the use of the accusative pronouns
with these “passive” forms in Celtic; Ir. -<i>m-berar</i>, “I am carried,”
literally “folk carry me”; Umb. <i>pir ferar</i>, literally <i>ignem feratur</i>,
though as <i>pir</i> is a neuter word (&#160;=&#160;Gr. <span title="pŷr"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">πῦρ</span></span>) this example was not so
convincing. But within a twelvemonth of the appearance of
Zimmer’s article, an Oscan inscription (Conway, <i>Camb. Philol.</i>
<i>Society’s Proceedings</i>, 1890, p. 16, and <i>Italic Dialects</i>, p. 113) was discovered
containing the phrase <i>ůltiumam</i> (<i>iůvilam</i>) <i>sakrafi̊r</i>, “ultimam
(imaginem) consecraverint” (or “ultima consecretur”)
which demonstrated the nature of the suffix in Italic also. This
originally active meaning of the -<i>r</i> form (in the third person singular
passive) is the cause of the remarkable fondness for the “impersonal”
use of the passive in Latin (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>itur in antiquam silvam</i>,
instead of <i>eunt</i>), which was naturally extended to all tenses of the
passive (<i>ventum est</i>, &amp;c.), so soon as its origin was forgotten. Fuller
details of the development will be found in Conway, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 561,
and the authorities there cited (very little is added by K. Brugmann,
<i>Kurze vergl. Gramm.</i> 1904, p. 596).
</p><p>(v.) Formation of the perfect passive from the -<i>to</i>- past participle,
Lat. <i>monitus</i> (<i>est</i>), &amp;c., Ir. <i>léic-the</i>, “he was left,” <i>ro-léiced</i>, “he has
been left.” In Latin the participle maintains its distinct adjectival
character; in Irish (J. Strachan, <i>Old Irish Paradigms</i>, 1905, p. 50) it
has sunk into a purely verbal form, just as the perfect participles in
-<i>us</i> in Umbrian have been absorbed into the future perfect in -<i>ust</i>
(<i>entelust</i>, “intenderit”; <i>benust</i>, “venerit”) with its impersonal passive
or third plural active -<i>us</i>(<i>s</i>)<i>so</i> (probably standing for -<i>ussor</i>) as in
<i>benuso</i>, “ventum erit” (or “venerint”).
</p><p>To these must be further added some striking peculiarities in
phonology.
</p><p>(vi.) Assimilation of <i>p</i> to a <i>q<span style="position: relative; bottom: 0.1em; font-size: 0.85em;">ṷ</span></i> in a following syllable as in Lat.
<i>quinque</i> = Ir. <i>cóic</i>, compared with Sans. <i>pánca</i>, Gr. <span title="pénte"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">πέντε</span></span>, Eng. <i>five</i>,
Ind.-Eur. *<i>penqe</i>.
</p><p>(vii.) Finally—and perhaps this parallelism is the most important
of all from the historical standpoint—both Italic and Celtic are
divided into two sub-families which differ, and differ in the same
way, in their treatment of the Ind.-Eur. velar tenuis <i>q</i>. In both
halves of each group it was labialized to some extent; in one half of
each group it was labialized so far as to become <i>p</i>. This is the great
line of cleavage (i.) between Latinian (Lat. <i>quod</i>, <i>quandō</i>, <i>quinque</i>;
Falisc. <i>cuando</i>) and Osco-Umbrian, better called Safine (Osc. <i>pod</i>,
Umb. <i>panū</i>- [for *<i>pandō</i>], Osc.-Umb. <i>pompe</i>-, “five,” in Osc.
<i>půmperias</i> “nonae,” Umb. <i>pumped̠̣ia</i>-, “fifth day of the month”);
and (ii.) between Goidelic (Gaelic) (O. Ir. <i>cóic</i>, “five,” <i>maq</i>, “son”;
modern Irish and Scotch <i>Mac</i> as in <i>MacPherson</i>) and Brythonic
(Britannic) (Welsh <i>pump</i>, “five,” <i>Ap</i> for <i>map</i>, as in <i>Powel</i> for <i>Ap</i>
<i>Howel</i>).
</p><p>The same distinction appears elsewhere; Germanic belongs,
broadly described, to the <i>q</i>-group, and Greek, broadly described,
to the <i>p</i>-group. The ethnological bearing of the distinction within
Italy is considered in the articles <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps"><a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Sabini" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Sabini">Sabini</a></span> and <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps"><a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Volsci" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Volsci">Volsci</a></span>; but the wider
questions which the facts suggest have as yet been only scantily
discussed; see the references for the “Sequanian” dialect of Gallic
(in the inscription of Coligny, whose language preserves <i>q</i>) in the
article <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps"><a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Celt_(people)#Language" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Celt (people)">Celts</a></span>: <i>Language</i>.
</p><p>From these primitive affinities we must clearly distinguish the
numerous words taken into Latin from the Celts of north Italy within
the historic period; for these see especially an interesting study by
J. Zwicker, <i>De vocabulis et rebus Gallicis sive Transpadanis apud</i>
<i>Vergilium</i> (Leipzig dissertation, 1905).
</p>
</div>
<p>6. <i>Greek and Italic.</i>—We have seen above (§ 4, i., ii., iii.) certain
broad characteristics which the Greek and the Italic groups of
language have in common. The old question of the degree of
their affinity may be briefly noticed. There are deep-seated
differences in morphology, phonology and vocabulary between
the two languages—such as (<i>a</i>) the loss of the forms of the
ablative in Greek and of the middle voice in Latin; (<i>b</i>) the decay
of the fricatives (<i>s</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>i̭</i>) in Greek and the cavalier treatment of
the aspirates in Latin; and (<i>c</i>) the almost total discrepancy of
the vocabularies of law and religion in the two languages—which
altogether forbid the assumption that the two groups can ever
have been completely identical after their first dialectic separation
from the parent language. On the other hand, in the first early
periods of that dialectic development in the Indo-European
family, the precursors of Greek and Italic cannot have been
separated by any very wide boundary. To this primitive
neighbourhood may be referred such peculiarities as (<i>a</i>) the
genitive plural feminine ending in -<i>āsōm</i> (Gr. <span title="-áōn"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">-άων</span></span>, later in
various dialects <span title="-eōn"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">-έων</span></span>, <span title="-ōn"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">-ῶν</span></span>, <span title="-ân"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">-ᾶν</span></span>; cf. Osc. <i>egmazum</i> “rerum”;
Lat. <i>mensarum</i>, with -<i>r</i>- from -<i>s</i>-), (<i>b</i>) the feminine gender of
many nouns of the -<i>o</i>- declension, cf. Gr. <span title="hē hodòs"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ἡ ὁδὸς</span></span>, Lat. <i>haec</i>
<i>fāgus</i>; and some important and ancient syntactical features,
especially in the uses of the cases (<i>e.g.</i> (<i>c</i>) the genitive of price)
of the (<i>d</i>) infinitive and of the (<i>e</i>) participles passive (though in&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="246" data-page-number="246" data-page-name="Page:EB1911 - Volume 16.djvu/266" data-page-index="266" data-page-quality="4" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_16.djvu/266"><span id="pageindex_266" class="pagenum-inner ws-noexport">&#8203;</span></span></span>each case the forms differ widely in the two groups), and perhaps
(<i>f</i> ) of the dependent moods (though here again the forms have
been vigorously reshaped in Italic). These syntactic parallels,
which are hardly noticed by Kretschmer in his otherwise careful
discussion (<i>Einleit.</i> p. 155 seq.), serve to confirm his general
conclusion which has been here adopted; because syntactic
peculiarities have a long life and may survive not merely complete
revolutions in morphology, but even a complete change in the
speaker’s language, <i>e.g.</i> such Celticisms in Irish-English as
“What are you after doing?” for “What have you done?” or
in Welsh-English as “whatever” for “anyhow.” A few isolated
correspondences in vocabulary, as in <i>remus</i> from *<i>ret-s-mo</i>-,
with <span title="eretmós"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ἐρετμός</span></span> and in a few plant-names (<i>e.g.</i> <span title="práson"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">πράσον</span></span> and <i>porrum</i>),
cannot disturb the general conclusion, though no doubt they
have some historical significance, if it could be determined.
</p><p>7. <i>Indo-Iranian and Italo-Celtic.</i>—Only a brief reference can
here be made to the striking list of resemblances between the
Indo-Iranian and Italo-Celtic groups, especially in vocabulary,
which Kretschmer has collected (<i>ibid.</i> pp. 126-144). The most
striking of these are <i>rēx</i>, O. Ir. <i>rīg</i>-, Sans. <i>rāj</i>-, and the political
meaning of the same root in the corresponding verb in both
languages (contrast <i>regere</i> with the merely physical meaning
of Gr. <span title="orégnymi"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ὀρέγνυμι</span></span>); Lat. <i>flāmen</i> (for *<i>flag-men</i>) exactly = Sans.
<i>brahman</i>- (neuter), meaning probably “sacrificing,” “worshipping,”
and then “priesthood,” “priest,” from the Ind.-Eur.
root *<i>bhelgh</i>-, “blaze,” “make to blaze”; <i>rēs</i>, <i>rem</i> exactly
= Sans. <i>rās</i>, <i>rām</i> in declension and especially in meaning; and
<i>Ārio</i>-, “noble,” in Gallic <i>Ariomanus</i>, &amp;c., = Sans. <i>ārya</i>-, “noble”
(whence “Aryan”). So <i>argentum</i> exactly = Sans. <i>rajata</i>-, Zend
<i>erezata</i>-; contrast the different (though morphologically kindred)
suffix in Gr. <span title="árgyros"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ἄργυρος</span></span>. Some forty-two other Latin or Celtic
words (among them <i>crēdere</i>, <i>caesariēs</i>, <i>probus</i>, <i>castus</i> (cf. Osc.
<i>kasit</i>, Lat. <i>caret</i>, Sans. <i>šiṣta</i>-), <i>Volcānus</i>, <i>Neptūnus</i>, <i>ensis</i>, <i>erus</i>,
<i>pruina</i>, <i>rūs</i>, <i>novācula</i>) have precise Sanskrit or Iranian equivalents,
and none so near in any other of the eight groups of
languages. Finally the use of an -<i>r</i> suffix in the third plural is
common to both Italo-Celtic (see above) and Indo-Iranian.
These things clearly point to a fairly close, and probably in part
political, intercourse between the two communities of speakers
at some early epoch. A shorter, but interesting, list of correspondences
in vocabulary with Balto-Slavonic (<i>e.g.</i> the words
<i>mentīrī</i>, <i>rōs</i>, <i>ignis</i> have close equivalents in Balto-Slavonic)
suggests that at the same period the precursor of this dialect
too was a not remote neighbour.
</p><p>8. <i>Date of the Separation of the Italic Group.</i>—The date at
which the Italic group of languages began to have (so far as it
had at all) a separate development of its own is at present only
a matter of conjecture. But the combination of archaeological
and linguistic research which has already begun can have no
more interesting object than the approximate determination
of this date (or group of dates); for it will give us a point of
cardinal importance in the early history of Europe. The only
consideration which can here be offered as a starting-point for
the inquiry is the chronological relation of the Etruscan invasion,
which is probably referable to the 12th century <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span> (see <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps"><a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Etruria" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Etruria">Etruria</a></span>),
to the two strata of Indo-European population—the -CO- folk
(<i>Falisci</i>, <i>Marruci</i>, <i>Volsci</i>, <i>Hernici</i> and others), to whom the
Tuscan invaders owe the names <i>Etrusci</i> and <i>Tusci</i>, and the
-NO- folk, who, on the West coast, in the centre and south of
Italy, appear at a distinctly later epoch, in some places (as in the
Bruttian peninsula, see <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps"><a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Bruttii" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Bruttii">Bruttii</a></span>) only at the beginning of our
historical record. If the view of Latin as mainly the tongue
of the -CO- folk prove to be correct (see <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps"><a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Rome" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Rome">Rome</a></span>: <i>History</i>; <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps"><a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Italy" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Italy">Italy</a></span>:

regard it (<i>a</i>) as the southern or earlier half of the Italic group,
firmly rooted in Italy in the 12th century <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span>, but (<i>b</i>) by no
means yet isolated from contact with the northern or later
half; such is at least the suggestion of the striking peculiarities
in morphology which it shares with not merely Oscan and
Umbrian, but also, as we have seen, with Celtic. The progress
in time of this isolation ought before long to be traced with
some approach to certainty.

<p><span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps">The History of Latin</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>9. We may now proceed to notice the chief changes that
arose in Latin after the (more or less) complete separation of
the Italic group whenever it came about. The contrasted
features of Oscan and Umbrian, to some of which, for special
reasons, occasional reference will be here made, are fully described

</p><p>It is rarely possible to fix with any precision the date at
which a particular change began or was completed, and the most
serviceable form for this conspectus of the development will
be to present, under the heads of Phonology, Morphology and
Syntax, the chief characteristics of Ciceronian Latin which we
know to have been developed after Latin became a separate
language. Which of these changes, if any, can be assigned to a
particular period will be seen as we proceed. But it should
be remembered that an enormous increase of exact knowledge
has accrued from the scientific methods of research introduced
by A. Leskien and K. Brugmann in 1879, and finally established
by Brugmann’s great <i>Grundriss</i> in 1886, and that only a brief
enumeration can be here attempted. For adequate study
reference must be made to the fuller treatises quoted, and
especially to the sections bearing on Latin in K. Brugmann’s
<i>Kurze vergleichende Grammatik</i> (1902).

<p>10. <i>The Latin Accent.</i>—It will be convenient to begin with some
account of the most important discovery made since the application
of scientific method to the study of Latin, for, though it is not
strictly a part of phonology, it is wrapped up with much of the
development both of the sounds and, by consequence, of the inflexions.
It has long been observed (as we have seen § 4, iv. above)
that the restriction of the word-accent in Latin to the last three
syllables of the word, and its attachment to a long syllable in the
penult, were certainly not its earliest traceable condition; between
this, the classical system, and the comparative freedom with which
the word-accent was placed in pro-ethnic Indo-European, there had
intervened a period of first-syllable accentuation to which were due
many of the characteristic contractions of Oscan and Umbrian, and
in Latin the degradation of the vowels in such forms as <i>accentus</i> from
<i>ad</i>+<i>cantus</i> or <i>praecipitem</i> from <i>prae</i>+<i>caput</i>- (§ 19 below). R. von
Planta (<i>Osk.-Umbr. Grammatik</i>, 1893, i. p. 594) pointed out that in
Oscan also, by the 3rd century <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span>, this first-syllable-accent had
probably given way to a system which limited the word-accent in
some such way as in classical Latin. But it remained for C. Exon, in
a brilliant article (<i>Hermathena</i> (1906), xiv. 117, seq.), to deduce from
the more precise stages of the change (which had been gradually
noted, see <i>e.g.</i> F. Skutsch in Kroll’s <i>Altertumswissenschaft <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed red;" title="amended from in">im</span></i>
<i>letzten Vierteljahrhundert</i>, 1905) their actual effect on the language.

</p><p><i>In pre-Plautine Latin</i> in all words or word-groups of four or more

*<i>súrregere</i>, *<i>surregḗmus</i>, and the like became <i>surgere</i>, <i>surgḗmus</i>, and

trisyllabic cases, <i>pósterus</i>, <i>pósterī</i>, &amp;c., to which the law did not
apply. Conversely, the nom. *<i>ā́ridor</i> (more correctly at this period
*<i>āridōs</i>), which would not have been contracted, followed the form
of <i>ārdṓrem</i> (from *<i>āridṓrem</i>), <i>ārdḗre</i>, &amp;c.
</p><p>The same change produced the monosyllabic forms <i>nec</i>, <i>ac</i>, <i>neu</i>,
<i>seu</i>, from <i>neque</i>, &amp;c., before consonants, since they had no accent of
their own, but were always pronounced in one breath with the
following word, <i>neque tántum</i> becoming <i>nec tantum</i>, and the like.
So in Plautus (and probably always in spoken Latin) the words
<i>nemp</i>(<i>e</i>), <i>ind</i>(<i>e</i>), <i>quipp</i>(<i>e</i>), <i>ill</i>(<i>e</i>), are regularly monosyllables.

far from universal syncope of final syllables in Latin (especially
before -<i>s</i>, as in <i>mēns</i>, which represents both Gr. <span title="menos"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">μένος</span></span> and Sans.
matís = Ind.-Eur. <i>mn̥tís</i>, Eng. <i>mind</i>) is due also to this law operating
on such combinations as <i>bona mēns</i> and the like, but this has not
yet been clearly shown. In any case the effects of any such phonetic
change have been very greatly modified by analogical changes.
The Oscan and Umbrian syncope of short vowels before final <i>s</i>
seems to be an independent change, at all events in its detailed
working. The outbreak of the unconscious affection of slurring
final syllables may have been contemporaneous.
</p><p>13. <i>In post-Plautine Latin</i> words accented on the ante-antepenult:—
</p><p>(i.) suffered syncope in the short syllable following the accented
syllable (<i>bálineae</i> became <i>bálneae</i>, <i>puéritia</i> became <i>puértia</i> (Horace),
<i>cólumine</i>, <i>tégimine</i>, &amp;c., became <i>cúlmine</i>, <i>tégmine</i>, &amp;c., beside the
trisyllabic <i>cólumen</i>, <i>tégimen</i>) unless
</p><p>(ii.) that short vowel was <i>e</i> or <i>i</i>, followed by another vowel (as in
<i>párietem</i>, <i>múlierem</i>, <i>Púteoli</i>), when, instead of contraction, the
accent shifted to the penult, which at a later stage of the language
became lengthened, <i>pariétem</i> giving Ital. <i>parḗte</i>, Fr. <i>paroi</i>, <i>Puteóli</i>
giving Ital. <i>Pozzuṓli</i>.
</p><p>The restriction of the accent to the last three syllables was completed
by these changes, which did away with all the cases in which it
had stood on the fourth syllable.
</p><p>14. <i>The Law of the Brevis Brevians.</i>—Next must be mentioned
another great phonetic change, also dependent upon accent, which
had come about before the time of Plautus, the law long known to
students as the <i>Brevis Brevians</i>, which may be stated as follows
(Exon, <i>Hermathena</i> (1903), xii. 491, following Skutsch in, <i>e.g.</i>,
Vollmöller’s <i>Jahresbericht für romanische Sprachwissenschaft</i>, i. 33):
a syllable long by nature or position, and preceded by a short
syllable, was itself shortened if the word-accent fell immediately
before or immediately after it—that is, on the preceding short
syllable or on the next following syllable. The sequence of syllables
need not be in the same word, but must be as closely connected in
utterance as if it were. Thus <i>mṓdō</i> became <i>módŏ</i>, <i>vŏlūptā́tēm</i> became
<i>vŏlŭ(p)tā́tem</i>, <i>quī́d ēst?</i> became <i>quid ĕst?</i> either the <i>s</i> or the <i>t</i> or both
being but faintly pronounced.
</p><p>It is clear that a great number of flexional syllables so shortened
would have their quantity immediately restored by the analogy of
the same inflexion occurring in words not of this particular shape;
thus, for instance, the long vowel of <i>ā́mā</i> and the like is due to that
in other verbs (<i>pulsā</i>, <i>agitā</i>) not of iambic shape. So ablatives like
<i>modō</i>, <i>sonō</i> get back their -<i>ō</i>, while in particles like <i>modo</i>, “only,”
<i>quōmodo</i>, “how,” the shortened form remains. Conversely, the
shortening of the final -<i>a</i> in the nom. sing. fem. of the <i>a</i>-declension
(contrast <i>lūnă</i> with Gr. <span title="chôrã"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">χωρᾱ&#769;</span></span>) was probably partly due to the
influence of common forms like <i>eă</i>, <i>bonă</i>, <i>mală</i>, which had come under
the law.
</p><p>15. <i>Effect on Verb Inflexion.</i>—These processes had far-reaching
effects on Latin inflexion. The chief of these was the creation of the
type of conjugation known as the <i>capio</i>-class. All these verbs were
originally inflected like <i>audio</i>, but the accident of their short root-syllable,
(in such early forms as *<i>fúgīs</i>, *<i>fugītū́rus</i>, *<i>fugīsḗtis</i>, &amp;c.,
becoming later <i>fúgĭs</i>, <i>fugĭtū́rus</i>, <i>fugĕrḗtis</i>) brought great parts of their
paradigm under this law, and the rest followed suit; but true forms
like <i>fugīre</i>, <i>cupīre</i>, <i>morīri</i>, never altogether died out of the spoken
language. St Augustine, for instance, confessed in 387 <span style="font-size: 83%;">A.D.</span> (<i>Epist.</i>
iii. 5, quoted by Exon, <i>Hermathena</i> (1901), xi. 383,) that he does not
know whether <i>cupi</i> or <i>cupiri</i> is the pass. inf. of <i>cupio</i>. Hence we
have Ital. <i>fuggīre</i>, <i>morīre</i>, Fr. <i>fuir</i>, <i>mourir</i>. (See further on this
conjugation, C. Exon, <i>l.c.</i>, and F. Skutsch, <i>Archiv für lat. Lexicographie</i>,
xii. 210, two papers which were written independently.)
</p><p>16. The question has been raised how far the true phonetic shortening
appears in Plautus, produced not by word-accent but by metrical
ictus—<i>e.g.</i> whether the reading is to be trusted in such lines as <i>Amph.</i>
761, which gives us <i>dedisse</i> as the first foot (tribrach) of a trochaic
line “because the metrical ictus fell on the syllable <i>ded</i>-”—but this
remarkable theory cannot be discussed here. See the articles cited
and also F. Skutsch, <i>Forschungen zu Latein. Grammatik und Metrik</i>,
i. (1892); C. Exon, <i>Hermathena</i> (1903) xii. p. 492, W. M. Lindsay,
<i>Captivi</i> (1900), appendix.
</p><p>In the history of the vowels and diphthongs in Latin we must
distinguish the changes which came about independently of accent
and those produced by the preponderance of accent in another syllable.
</p><p>17. <i>Vowel Changes independent of Accent.</i>—In the former category
the following are those of chief importance:—
</p><p>(i.) <i>ĭ</i> became <i>ĕ</i> (<i>a</i>) when final, as in <i>ant-e</i> beside Gr. <span title="anti"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ἀντί</span></span>, <i>trīste</i>
besides <i>trīsti-s</i>, contrasted with <i>e.g.</i>, the Greek neuter <span title="idri"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ἴδρι</span></span> (the final
-<i>e</i> of the infinitive—<i>regere</i>, &amp;c.—is the -<i>ĭ</i> of the locative, just as in the
so-called ablatives <i>genere</i>, &amp;c.); (<i>b</i>) before -<i>r</i>- which has arisen from
-<i>s</i>-, as in <i>cineris</i> beside <i>cinis</i>, <i>cinisculus</i>; <i>serō</i> beside Gr. <span title="i(s)êmi"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ἴ(σ)ημι</span></span> (Ind.-Eur.
*<i>si-sēmi</i>, a reduplicated non-thematic present).
</p><p>(ii.) Final <i>ŏ</i> became <i>ĕ</i>; imperative <i>sequere</i> = Gr. <span title="epe(s)o"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ἔπε(σ)ο</span></span>; Lat. <i>ille</i>
may contain the old pronoun *<i>so</i>, “he,” Gr. <span title="ho"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ὁ</span></span>, Sans. <i>sa</i> (otherwise
Skutsch, <i>Glotta</i>, i. Hefte 2-3).
</p><p>(iii.) <i>el</i> became <i>ol</i> when followed by any sound save <i>e</i>, <i>i</i> or <i>l</i>, as in
<i>volō</i>, <i>volt</i> beside <i>velle</i>; <i>colō</i> beside Gr. <span title="tellomai"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">τέλλομαι</span></span>, <span title="polein"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">πολεῖν</span></span>, Att. <span title="telos"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">τέλος</span></span>;
<i>colōnus</i> for *<i>quelōnus</i>, beside <i>inquilīnus</i> for *<i>en-quēlenus</i>.
</p><p>(iv.) <i>e</i> became <i>i</i> (i.) before a nasal followed by a palatal or velar
consonant (<i>tingo</i>, Gr. <span title="teggô"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">τέγγω</span></span>; <i>in-cipio</i> from *<i>en-capio</i>); (ii.) under
certain conditions not yet precisely defined, one of which was <i>i</i> in a
following syllable (<i>nihil</i>, <i>nisi</i>, <i>initium</i>). From these forms <i>in</i>- spread
and banished <i>en</i>-, the earlier form.
</p><p>(v.) The “neutral vowel” (“schwa Indo-Germanicum”) which
arose in pro-ethnic Indo-European from the reduction of long
<i>ā</i>, <i>ē</i> or <i>ō</i> in unaccented syllables (as in the -<i>tós</i> participles of such roots
as <i>stā</i>-, <i>dhē</i>-, <i>dō</i>-, *<i>stətós</i>, *<i>dhətós</i>, *<i>dətós</i>) became <i>a</i> in Latin (<i>status</i>
con-ditus<i> [from *</i>con-dhatos<i>], </i>datus<i>), and it is the same sound which</i>
is represented by <i>a</i> in most of the forms of <i>dō</i> (<i>damus</i>, <i>dabō</i>, &amp;c.).
</p><p>(vi.) When a long vowel came to stand before another vowel in
the same word through loss of <i>i̭</i> or <i>ṷ</i>, it was always shortened; thus
the -<i>eō</i> of intransitive verbs like <i>candeō</i>, <i>caleō</i> is for -<i>ēi̭ō</i> (where the <i>ē</i>
is identical with the &#951; in Gr. <span title="ephanên"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ἐφάνην</span></span>, <span title="emanên"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ἐμάνην</span></span>) and was thus confused
with the causative -<i>eiō</i> (as in <i>moneō</i>, “I make to think,” &amp;c.), where
the short <i>e</i> is original. So <i>audīuī</i> became <i>audīī</i> and thence <i>audiī</i>
(the form audīvī would have disappeared altogether but for being
restored from <i>audīveram</i>, &amp;c.; conversely <i>audieram</i> is formed from
<i>audiī</i>). In certain cases the vowels contracted, as in <i>trēs</i>, <i>partēs</i>, &amp;c.
with -<i>ēs</i> from <i>ei̭es</i>, *<i>amō</i> from <i>amā(i̭)ō</i>.
</p><p>18. <i>Of the Diphthongs.</i>
</p><p>(vii.) <i>eu</i> became <i>ou</i> in pro-ethnic Italic, Lat. <i>novus</i>: Gr. <span title="neos"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">νέος</span></span>,
Lat. <i>novem</i>, Umb. <i>nuviper</i> (<i>i.e.</i> <i>noviper</i>), “usque ad
<span style="text-align: left; width: 10em; float: left; padding: 0.4em 0.8em 0.4em 0em; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 85%; line-height: 1.3em;">Changes of the diphthongs independent of accent.</span>
noviens”: Gr. <span title="(en-)nea"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">(ἐν-)νέα</span></span>; in unaccented syllables this
-<i>ov</i>- sank to -<i>u(v)</i>- as in <i>dḗnuō</i> from <i>dḗ novō</i>, <i>suus</i> (which is
rarely anything but an enclitic word), Old Lat. <i>sovos</i>:
Gr. <span title="he(w)os"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ἑ(ϝ)ός</span></span>.
</p><p>(viii.) <i>ou</i>, whether original or from <i>eu</i>, when in one syllable
became -<i>ū</i>-, probably about 200 <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span>, as in <i>dūcō</i>, Old Lat. <i>doucō</i>,
Goth, <i>tiuhan</i>, Eng. <i>tow</i>, Ind.-Eur. *<i>deṷcō</i>.
</p><p>(ix.) <i>ei</i> became <i>ī</i> (as in <i>dīcō</i>, Old Lat. <i>deico</i>: Gr. <span title="deik"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">δείκ</span></span>-<span title="nymi"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">νυμι</span></span>, <i>fīdo</i>: Gr.
<span title="peithomai"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">πείθομαι</span></span>, Ind.-Eur. *<i>bheidhō</i>) just before the time of Lucilius, who
prescribes the spellings <i>puerei</i> (nom. plur.) but <i>puerī</i> (gen. sing.),
which indicates that the two forms were pronounced alike in his
time, but that the traditional distinction in spelling had been more
or less preserved. But after his time, since the sound of <i>ei</i> was
merely that of <i>ī</i>, <i>ei</i> is continually used merely to denote a long <i>ī</i>, even
where, as in <i>faxeis</i> for faxīs, there never had been any diphthongal
sound at all.
</p><p>(x.) In rustic Latin (Volscian and Sabine) <i>au</i> became <i>ō</i> as in the
vulgar terms <i>explōdere</i>, <i>plōstrum</i>. Hence arose interesting doublets
of meaning;—<i>lautus</i> (the Roman form), “elegant,” but <i>lōtus</i>,
“washed”; <i>haustus</i>, “draught,” but <i>hōstus</i> (Cato), “the season’s
yield of fruit.”
</p><p>(xi.) <i>oi</i> became <i>oe</i> and thence <i>ū</i> some time after Plautus, as in
<i>ūnus</i>, Old Lat. <i>oenus</i>: Gr. <span title="oinê"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">οἰνή</span></span> “ace.” In Plautus the forms have
nearly all been modernized, save in special cases, <i>e.g.</i> in <i>Trin.</i> i.
1, 2, <i>immoene facinus</i>, “a thankless task,” has not been changed to
<i>immune</i> because that meaning had died out of the adjective so that
<i>immune facinus</i> would have made nonsense; but at the end of the
same line <i>utile</i> has replaced <i>oetile</i>. Similarly in a small group of
words the old form was preserved through their frequent use in legal
or religious documents where tradition was strictly preserved—<i>poena</i>,
<i>foedus</i> (neut.), <i>foedus</i> (adj.), “ill-omened.” So the archaic
and poetical <i>moenia</i>, “ramparts,” beside the true classical form
<i>mūnia</i>, “duties”; the historic <i>Poeni</i> beside the living and frequently
used <i>Pūnicum</i> (<i>bellum</i>)—an example which demonstrates conclusively
(<i>pace</i> Sommer) that the variation between <i>ū</i> and <i>oe</i> is not
due to any difference in the surrounding sounds.
</p><p>(xii.) <i>ai</i> became <i>ae</i> and this in rustic and later Latin (2nd or 3rd
century <span style="font-size: 83%;">A.D.</span>) simple <i>ē</i>, though of an open quality—Gr. <span title="aithos"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">αἴθος</span></span>, <span title="aithô"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">αἴθω</span></span>,
Lat. <i>aedēs</i> (originally “the place for the fire”); the country forms
of <i>haedus</i>, <i>praetor</i> were <i>edus</i>, <i>pretor</i> (Varro, <i>Ling. Lat.</i> v. 97, Lindsay,
<i>Lat. Lang.</i> p. 44).
</p><p>19. <i>Vowels and Diphthongs in unaccented Syllables.</i>—The changes
of the short vowels and of the diphthongs in unaccented syllables are
too numerous and complex to be set forth here. Some took place
under the first-syllable system of accent, some later (§§ 9, 10).
Typical examples are <i>pep</i>E<i>rci</i> from *<i>péparcai</i> and <i>ónustus</i> from
*<i>ónostos</i> (before two consonants); <i>concIno</i> from *<i>cóncano</i> and <i>hosp</i>I<i>t</i>I<i>s</i>
from *<i>hóstipotes</i>, <i>leg</i>I<i>mus</i> beside Gr. <span title="legomen"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">λέγομεν</span></span> (before one consonant);
<i>Sic</i>U<i>li</i> from *<i>Siceloi</i> (before a thick <i>l</i>, see § 17, 3); <i>dil</i>I<i>g</i>I<i>t</i> from
*<i>dísleget</i> (contrast, however, the preservation of the second <i>e</i> in
<i>negl</i>E<i>g</i>I<i>t</i>); <i>occ</i>U<i>pat</i> from *<i>opcapat</i> (contrast <i>accipit</i> with <i>i</i> in the
following syllable); the varying spelling in <i>monumentum</i> and
<i>monimentum</i>, <i>maxumus</i> and <i>maximus</i>, points to an intermediate sound
(<i>ü</i>) between <i>u</i> and <i>i</i> (cf. Quint. i. 4. 8, reading <i>optumum</i> and <i>optimum</i>
[not <i>opimum</i>] with W. M. Lindsay, <i>Latin Language</i> §§ 14, 16, seq.),
which could not be correctly represented in spelling; this difference
may, however, be due merely to the effect of differences in the
neighbouring sounds, an effect greatly obscured by analogical influences.
</p><p>Inscriptions of the 4th or 3rd century, <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span> which show original
-<i>es</i> and -<i>os</i> in final syllables (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Venerĕs</i>, gen. sing., <i>nāvebos</i> abl. pl.)
compared with the usual forms in -<i>is</i>, -<i>us</i> a century later, give us
roughly the date of these changes. But final -<i>os</i>, -<i>om</i>, remained after
-<i>u</i>- (and <i>v</i>) down to 50 <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span> as in <i>servos</i>.
</p><p>20. Special mention should be made of the change of -<i>rĭ</i>- and -<i>ro</i>-
to -<i>er</i>- (<i>incertus</i> from *<i>encritos</i>; <i>ager</i>, <i>ācer</i> from *<i>agros</i>, *<i>ācris</i>; the&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="248" data-page-number="248" data-page-name="Page:EB1911 - Volume 16.djvu/268" data-page-index="268" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_16.djvu/268"><span id="pageindex_268" class="pagenum-inner ws-noexport">&#8203;</span></span></span>feminine <i>ācris</i> was restored in Latin (though not in North Oscan) by
the analogy of other adjectives, like <i>tristis</i>, while the masculine <i>ācer</i>
was protected by the parallel masculine forms of the -<i>o</i>- declension,
like <i>tener</i>, <i>niger</i> [from *<i>teneros</i>, *<i>nigros</i>]).
</p><p>21. Long vowels generally remained unchanged, as in <i>compāgo</i>,
<i>condōno</i>.
</p><p>22. Of the diphthongs, <i>ai</i> and <i>oi</i> both sank to <i>ei</i>, and with original
<i>ei</i> further to <i>ī</i>, in unaccented syllables, as in <i>Achivi</i> from Gr. <span title="Achaiwoi"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">Ἀχαιϝοί</span></span>,
<i>olīivom</i>, earlier *<i>oleivom</i> (borrowed into Gothic and there becoming
<i>alēv</i>) from Gr. <span title="elaiwon"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ἔλαιϝον</span></span>. This gives us interesting chronological data,
since the <i>el</i>- must have changed to <i>ol</i>- (§ 16. 3) before the change of
-<i>ai</i>- to -<i>ei</i>-, and that before the change of the accent from the first
syllable to the penultimate (§ 9); and the borrowing took place after
-<i>ai</i>- had become -<i>ei</i>-, but before -<i>eivom</i> had become -<i>eum</i>, as it regularly
did before the time of Plautus.
</p><p>But cases of <i>ai</i>, <i>ae</i>, which arose later than the change to <i>ei</i>, <i>ī</i>,
were unaffected by it; thus the nom. plur. of the first declension
originally ended in -<i>ās</i> (as in Oscan), but was changed at some period
before Plautus to -<i>ae</i> by the influence of the pronominal nom. plur.
ending -<i>ae</i> in <i>quae</i>? <i>hae</i>, &amp;c., which was accented in these monosyllables
and had therefore been preserved. The history of the -<i>ae</i>
of the dative, genitive and locative is hardly yet clear (see Exon,
<i>Hermathena</i> (1905), xiii. 555; K. Brugmann, <i>Grundriss</i>, 1st ed. ii.
571, 601).
</p><p>The diphthongs <i>au</i>, <i>ou</i> in unaccented syllables sank to -<i>u</i>-, as in
<i>inclūdō</i> beside <i>claudō</i>; the form <i>clūdō</i>, taken from the compounds,
superseded <i>claudo</i> altogether after Cicero’s time. So <i>cūdō</i>, taken
from <i>incūdō</i>, <i>excūdō</i>, banished the older *<i>caudō</i>, “I cut, strike,”
with which is probably connected <i>cauda</i>, “the striking member,
tail,” and from which comes <i>caussa</i>, “a cutting, decision, legal case,”
whose -<i>ss</i>- shows that it is derived from a root ending in a dental
(see §25 (<i>b</i>) below and Conway, <i>Verner’s Law in Italy</i>, p. 72).
</p><p><i>Consonants.</i>—Passing now to the chief changes of the consonants
we may notice the following points:—
</p><p>23. Consonant <i>i</i> (wrongly written <i>j</i>; there is no <i>g</i>-sound in the
letter), conveniently written <i>i̭</i> by phoneticians,
</p><p>(i.) was lost between vowels, as in <i>trēs</i> for *<i>trei̭es</i>, &amp;c. (§
17. 6);
</p><p>(ii.) in combination: -<i>mi̭</i>- became -<i>ni</i>-, as in <i>veniö</i>, from Ind.-Eur.
*Ƨṷ <i>mi̭o</i>, “I come,” Sans. <i>gam</i>-, Eng. <i>come</i>; -<i>ni̭</i>- probably (under
certain conditions at least) became -<i>nd</i>-, as in <i>tendō</i> beside Gr. <span title="teinô"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">τείνω</span></span>,
<i>fendō</i> = Gr. <span title="theinô"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">θείνω</span></span>, and in the gerundive stem -<i>endus</i>, -<i>undus</i>, probably
for -<i>eni̭os</i>, -<i>oni̭os</i>; cf. the Sanskrit gerundive in -<i>an-īya-s</i>; -<i>gi̭</i>-, -<i>di̭</i>-
became -<i>i̭</i>- as in <i>māior</i> from *<i>mag-ior</i>, <i>pēior</i> from *<i>ped-ior</i>;
</p><p>(iii.) otherwise -<i>i̭</i>- after a consonant became generally syllabic
(-<i>ii̭</i>-), as in <i>capiō</i> (trisyllabic) beside Goth. <i>hafya</i>.
</p><p>24. Consonant <i>u</i> (formerly represented by English <i>v</i>), conveniently
written <i>ṷ</i>,
</p><p>(i.) was lost between similar vowels when the first was accented,
as in <i>audīui</i>, which became <i>audiī</i> (§ 17 [6]), but not in <i>amāuī</i>, nor in
<i>avārus</i>.
</p><p>(ii.) in combination: <i>dṷ</i> became <i>b</i>, as in <i>bonus</i>, <i>bellum</i>, O. Lat.
<i>dṷonus</i>, *<i>dṷellum</i> (though the poets finding this written form in old
literary sources treated it as trisyllabic); <i>pṷ</i>-, <i>fṷ</i>-, <i>bṷ</i>-, lost the <i>ṷ</i>,
as in <i>ap-erio</i>, <i>op-erio</i> beside Lith. -<i>veriu</i>, “I open,” Osc. <i>veru</i>, “gate,”
and in the verbal endings -<i>bam</i>, -<i>bō</i>, from -<i>bhṷ-ām</i>, -<i>bhṷō</i> (with the
root of Lat. <i>fui</i>), and <i>fīo</i>, <i>du-bius</i>, <i>super-bus</i>, <i>vasta-bundus</i>, &amp;c.,
from the same; -<i>sṷ</i>- between vowels (at least when the second was
accented) disappeared (see below § 25 (<i>a</i>), iv.), as in <i>pruīna</i> for <i>prusuīna</i>,
cf. Eng. <i>fros-t</i>, Sans, <i>pruṣvā</i>, “hoar-frost.” Contrast <i>Minérva</i>
from an earlier *<i>menes-ṷā</i>, <i>sṷe</i>-, <i>sṷo</i>-, both became so-, as in <i>sorōor</i>(<i>em</i>)
beside Sans. <i>svasār-am</i>, Ger. <i>schwes-t-er</i>, Eng. <i>sister</i>, <i>sordēs</i>, beside
O. Ger. <i>swart-s</i>, mod. <i>schwarz</i>. -<i>ṷo</i>- in final syllables became -<i>u</i>-,
as in <i>cum</i> from <i>quom</i>, <i>parum</i> from <i>parṷom</i>; but in the declensional
forms -<i>ṷu</i>- was commonly restored by the analogy of the other cases,
thus (<i>a</i>) <i>serṷos</i>, <i>serṷom</i>, <i>serṷī</i> became (<i>b</i>) *<i>serus</i>, *<i>serum</i>, *<i>serṷi</i>, but
finally (<i>c</i>) <i>serṷus</i>, <i>serṷum</i>, <i>serṷi</i>.
</p><p>(iii.) In the 2nd century <span style="font-size: 83%;">A.D.</span>, Lat. <i>v</i> (<i>i.e.</i> <i>ṷ</i>) had become a voiced
labio-dental fricative, like Eng. <i>v</i>; and the voiced labial plosive <i>b</i>
had broken down (at least in certain positions) into the same sound;
hence they are frequently confused as in spellings like <i>vene</i> for <i>bene</i>,
<i>Bictorinus</i> for <i>Victorinus</i>.
</p><p>25. (<i>a</i>) Latin <i>s</i>
</p><p>(i.) became <i>r</i> between vowels between 450 and 350 <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span> (for the
date see R. S. Conway, <i>Verner’s Law in Italy</i>, pp. 61-64), as <i>āra</i>,
beside O. Lat. <i>āsa</i>, <i>generis</i> from *<i>geneses</i>, Gr. <span title="geneos"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">γένεος</span></span>; <i>eram</i>, <i>erō</i> for
*<i>esām</i>, *<i>esō</i>, and so in the verbal endings -<i>erām</i>, -<i>erō</i>, -<i>erim</i>. But a
considerable number of words came into Latin, partly from neighbouring
dialects, with -<i>s</i>- between vowels, after 350 <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span>, when the
change ceased, and so show -<i>s</i>-, as <i>rosa</i> (probably from S. Oscan for
*<i>rodi̭a</i> “rose-bush” cf. Gr. <span title="rhodon"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ῥόδον</span></span>), <i>cāseus</i>, “cheese,” <i>miser</i>, a term
of abuse, beside Gr. <span title="mysaros"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">μυσαρός</span></span> (probably also borrowed from south
Italy), and many more, especially the participles in -<i>sus</i> (<i>fūsus</i>),
where the -<i>s</i>- was -<i>ss</i>- at the time of the change of -<i>s</i>- to -<i>r</i>- (so in
<i>causa</i>, see above). All attempts to explain the retention of the -<i>s</i>-
otherwise must be said to have failed (<i>e.g.</i> the theory of accentual
difference in <i>Verner’s Law in Italy</i>, or that of dissimilation, given by
Brugmann, <i>Kurze vergl. Gram.</i> p. 242).
</p><p>(ii.) <i>sr</i> became <i>þr</i> (&#160;=&#160;Eng. <i>thr</i> in <i>throw</i>) in pro-ethnic Italic, and
this became initially <i>fr</i>- as in <i>frīgus</i>, Gr. <span title="rhigos"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ῥῖγος</span></span> (Ind.-Eur. *<i>srīgos</i>), but
medially -<i>br</i>-, as in <i>funebris</i>, from <i>funus</i>, stem <i>funes</i>-.
</p><p>(iii.) -<i>rs</i>-, <i>ls</i>- became -<i>rr</i>-, -<i>ll</i>-, as in <i>ferre</i>, <i>velle</i>, for *<i>fer-se</i>, *<i>vel-se</i>
(cf. <i>es-se</i>).
</p><p>(iv.) Before <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>l</i>, and <i>v</i>, -<i>s</i>- vanished, having previously caused
the loss of any preceding plosive or -<i>n</i>-, and the preceding vowel, if
short, was lengthened as in
</p>
<div style="padding-left: 4em; text-indent: -2em">
<p><i>prīmus</i> from *<i>prismos</i>, Paelig. <i>prismu</i>, “prima,” beside <i>pris-cus</i>.

</p><p><i>sēvirī</i> from *<i>sex-virī</i>, <i>ēvehō</i> from *<i>ex-vehō</i>, and so <i>ē-mittō</i>, <i>ē-līdō</i>,
<i>ē-numerō</i>, and from these forms arose the proposition <i>ē</i>
instead of <i>ex</i>.
</p>
</div>
<p>(v.) Similarly -<i>sd</i>- became -<i>d</i>-, as in <i>īdem</i> from <i>is-dem</i>.
</p><p>(vi.) Before <i>n</i>-, <i>m</i>-, <i>l</i>-, initially <i>s</i>- disappeared, as in <i>nūbo</i> beside
Old Church Slavonic <i>snubiti</i>, “to love, pay court to”; <i>mīror</i> beside
Sans, <i>smáyatē</i>, “laughs,” Eng. <i>smi-le</i>; <i>lūbricus</i> beside Goth, <i>sliupan</i>,
Eng. <i>slip</i>.
</p><p>(<i>b</i>) Latin -<i>ss</i>- arose from an original -<i>t</i> + <i>t</i>-, -<i>d</i> + <i>t</i>-, -<i>dh</i> + <i>t</i>- (except
before -<i>r</i>), as in <i>missus</i>, earlier *<i>mit-tos</i>; <i>tōnsus</i>, earlier *<i>tond-tos</i>, but
<i>tonstrīx</i> from *<i>tond-trīx</i>. After long vowels this -<i>ss</i>- became a single -<i>s</i>- some
time before Cicero (who wrote <i>caussa</i> [see above], <i>divissio</i>,
&amp;c., but probably only pronounced them with -<i>s</i>-, since the -<i>ss</i>- came
to be written single directly after his time).
</p><p>26. Of the Indo-European velars the breathed <i>q</i> was usually preserved
in Latin with a labial addition of -<i>ṷ</i>- (as in <i>sequor</i>, Gr. <span title="epomai"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ἕπομαι</span></span>,
Goth, <i>saihvan</i>, Eng. <i>see</i>; <i>quod</i>, Gr. <span title="pod-(apos)"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ποδ-(απός)</span></span>, Eng. <i>what</i>); but the
voiced Ƨṷ remained (as -<i>gu</i>-) only after -<i>n</i>- (<i>unguo</i> beside Ir. <i>imb</i>,
“butter”) and (as <i>g</i>) before <i>r</i>, <i>l</i>, and <i>u</i> (as in <i>gravis</i>, Gr. <span title="barys"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">βαρύς</span></span>; <i>glans</i>,
Gr. <span title="balanos"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">βάλανος</span></span>; <i>legūmen</i>, Gr. <span title="lobos"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">λοβός</span></span>, <span title="lebinthos"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">λεβίνθος</span></span>). Elsewhere it became <i>v</i>,
as in <i>veniō</i> (see § 23, ii.), <i>nūdus</i> from *<i>novedos</i>, Eng. <i>naked</i>. Hence
<i>bōs</i> (Sans. <i>gāus</i>, Eng. <i>cow</i>) must be regarded as a farmer’s word
borrowed from one of the country dialects (<i>e.g.</i> Sabine); the pure
Latin would be *<i>vōs</i>, and its oblique cases, <i>e.g.</i> acc. *<i>vovem</i>, would be
inconveniently close in sound to the word for sheep <i>ovem</i>.
</p><p>27. The treatment of the Indo-European voiced aspirates (<i>bh</i>,
<i>dh</i>, <i>ĝh</i> <i>Ƨh</i>) in Latin is one of the most marked characteristics of the
language, which separates it from all the other Italic dialects, since
the fricative sounds, which represented the Indo-European aspirates
in pro-ethnic Italic, remained fricatives medially if they remained at
all in that position in Oscan and Umbrian, whereas in Latin they
were nearly always changed into voiced explosives. Thus—

Latin phonology may serve as an introduction to its principles, and
give some insight into the phonetic character of the language. For
systematic study reference must be made to the standard books,

his <i>Kurze vergleichende Grammatik</i> (Strassburg, 1902); these contain
still by far the best accounts of Latin; Max Niederman, <i>Précis de</i>

excellently planned; F. Sommer, <i>Lateinische Laut- und Flexionslehre</i>
(Heidelberg, 1902), containing many new conjectures; W. M.
Lindsay, <i>The Latin Language</i> (Oxford, 1894), translated into German
(with corrections) by Nohl (Leipzig, 1897), a most valuable collection
of material, especially from the ancient grammarians, but not always
accurate in phonology; F. Stolz, vol. i. of a joint <i>Historische Grammatik</i>

of material, especially in morphology, which is still of great value.
W. G. Hale and C. D. Buck’s <i>Latin Grammar</i> (Boston, 1903), though
on a smaller scale, is of very great importance, as it contains the
fruit of much independent research on the part of both authors; in
the difficult questions of orthography it was, as late as 1907, the only
safe guide.

<div class="tiInherit" style="text-align:center;">
<p><span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps">II. Morphology</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>In morphology the following are the most characteristic Latin
innovations:—
</p><p>29. <i>In nouns.</i>
</p><p>(i.) The complete loss of the dual number, save for a survival in
the dialect of Praeneste (<i>C.I.L.</i> xiv. 2891, = Conway, <i>Ital. Dial.</i> p. 285,
where <i>Q. k. Cestio Q. f.</i> seems to be nom. dual); so <i>C.I.L.</i> xi. 6706<sub>5</sub>,
T. C. Vomanio, see W. Schulze, <i>Lat. Eigennamen</i>, p. 117.
</p><p>(ii.) The introduction of new forms in the gen. sing, of the -<i>o</i>- stems
(<i>dominī</i>), of the -<i>ā</i>- stems (<i>mēnsae</i>) and in the nom. plural of the
same two declensions; innovations mostly derived from the pronominal
declension.
</p><p>(iii.) The development of an adverbial formation out of what was
either an instrumental or a locative of the -<i>o</i>- stems, as in <i>longē</i>.
And here may be added the other adverbial developments, in -<i>m</i>
(<i>palam</i>, <i>sensim</i>) probably accusative, and -<i>iter</i>, which is simply the
accusative of <i>iter</i>, “way,” crystallized, as is shown especially
by the fact that though in the end it attached itself particularly to
adjectives of the third declension (<i>molliter</i>), it appears also from
adjectives of the second declension whose meaning made their combination
with <i>iter</i> especially natural, such as <i>longiter</i>, <i>firmiter</i>, <i>largiter</i>
(cf. English <i>straightway</i>, <i>longways</i>). The only objections to this
derivation which had any real weight (see F. Skutsch, <i>De nominibus</i>
<i>no- suffixi ope formatis</i>, 1890, pp. 4-7) have been removed by
Exon’s Law (§ 11), which supplies a clear reason why the contracted
type <i>constanter</i> arose in and was felt to be proper to Participial
adverbs, while <i>firmiter</i> and the like set the type for those formed
from adjectives.
</p><p>(iv.) The development of the so-called fifth declension by a re-adjustment
of the declension of the nouns formed with the suffix -<i>iē</i>-:
<i>ia</i>- (which appears, for instance, in all the Greek feminine participles,
and in a more abstract sense in words like <i>māteriēs</i>) to match the
inflexion of two old root-nouns <i>rēs</i> and <i>diēs</i>, the stems of which were
originally <i>rēi̭</i>- (Sans. <i>rās</i>, <i>rāyas</i>, cf. Lat. <i>reor</i>) and <i>diēṷ</i>-.
</p><p>(v.) The disuse of the -<i>ti</i>- suffix in an abstract sense. The great
number of nouns which Latin inherited formed with this suffix were
either (1) marked as abstract by the addition of the further suffix
-<i>ōn</i>- (as in <i>natio</i> beside the Gr. <span title="gnêsi-os"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">γνὴσι–ος</span></span>, &amp;c.) or else (2) confined to a
concrete sense; thus <i>vectis</i>, properly “a carrying, lifting,” came to
mean “pole, lever”; <i>ratis</i>, properly a “reckoning, devising,” came
to mean “an (improvised) raft” (contrast <i>ratiō</i>); <i>postis</i>, a “placing,”
came to mean “post.”
</p><p>(vi.) The confusion of the consonantal stems with stems ending in
-<i>ĭ</i>-. This was probably due very largely to the forms assumed
through phonetic changes by the gen. sing. and the nom. and acc.
plural. Thus at say 300 <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span> the inflexions probably were:

</tbody></table>
<p>The confusing difference of signification of the long -<i>ēs</i> ending led
to a levelling of these and other forms in the two paradigms.
</p><p>(vii.) The disuse of the <i>u</i> declension (Gr. <span title="hêdys"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ἡδύς</span></span>, <span title="stachys"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">στάχυς</span></span>) in adjectives;
this group in Latin, thanks to its feminine form (Sans. fem.
<i>svādvī</i>, “sweet”), was transferred to the <i>i</i> declension (<i>suavis</i>, <i>gravis</i>,
<i>levis</i>, <i>dulcis</i>).
</p><p>30. <i>In verbs.</i>
</p><p>(i.) The disuse of the distinction between the personal endings of
primary and secondary tenses, the -<i>t</i> and -<i>nt</i>, for instance, being used
for the third person singular and plural respectively in all tenses and
moods of the active. This change was completed after the archaic
period, since we find in the oldest inscriptions -<i>d</i> regularly used in the
third person singular of past tenses, <i>e.g.</i> <i>deded</i>, <i>feced</i> in place of the
later <i>dedit</i>, <i>fecit</i>; and since in Oscan the distinction was preserved to
the end, both in singular and plural, <i>e.g.</i> <i>faamat</i> (perhaps meaning
“auctionatur”), but <i>deded</i> (“dedit”). It is commonly assumed from
the evidence of Greek and Sanskrit (Gr. <span title="hesti"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ἕστι</span></span>, Sans. <i>asti</i> beside Lat.
est) that the primary endings in Latin have lost a final -<i>i</i>, partly or
wholly by some phonetic change.
</p><p>(ii.) The non-thematic conjugation is almost wholly lost, surviving
only in a few forms of very common use, <i>est</i>, “is”; <i>ēst</i>,
“eats”; <i>volt</i>, “wills,” &amp;c.
</p><p>(iii.) The complete fusion of the aorist and perfect forms, and in
the same tense the fusion of active and middle endings; thus
<i>tutudī</i>, earlier *<i>tutudai</i>, is a true middle perfect; <i>dīxī</i> is an <i>s</i> aorist with
the same ending attached; <i>dīxit</i> is an aorist active; <i>tutudisti</i> is a
conflation of perfect and aorist with a middle personal ending.
</p><p>(iv.) The development of perfects in -<i>uī</i> and -<i>vī</i>, derived partly
from true perfects of roots ending in <i>v</i> or <i>u</i>, <i>e.g.</i> <i>mōvī</i> <i>ruī</i>. For the
origin of <i>monuī</i> see Exon, <i>Hermathena</i> (1901), xi. 396 sq.
</p><p>(v.) The complete fusion of conjunctive and optative into a single
mood, the subjunctive; <i>regam</i>, &amp;c., are conjunctive forms, whereas
<i>rexerim</i>, <i>rexissem</i> are certainly and <i>regerem</i> most probably optative;
the origin of <i>amem</i> and the like is still doubtful. Notice, however,
that true conjunctive forms were often used as futures, <i>regēs</i>, <i>reget</i>,
&amp;c., and also the simple thematic conjunctive in forms like <i>erō</i>,
<i>rexerō</i>, &amp;c.
</p><p>(vi.) The development of the future in -<i>bo</i> and imperfect in -<i>bam</i>
by compounding some form of the verb, possibly the Present
Participle with forms from the root of <i>fuī</i>, *<i>amans-fuo</i> becoming
<i>amabō</i>, *<i>amans-fṷām</i> becoming <i>amābam</i> at a very early period of
Latin; see F. Skutsch, <i>Atti d. Congresso Storico Intern.</i> (1903),
vol. ii. p. 191.
</p><p>(vii.) We have already noticed the rise of the passive in -<i>r</i> (§ 5 (<i>d</i>)).
Observe, however, that several middle forms have been pressed into
the service, partly because the -<i>r</i>- in them which had come from -<i>s</i>-
seemed to give them a passive colour (<i>legere</i> = Gr. <span title="lege(s)o"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">λέγε(σ)ο</span></span>, Attic
<span title="legou"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">λέγου</span></span>). The interesting forms in -<i>minī</i> are a confusion of two distinct
inflexions, namely, an old infinitive in -<i>menai</i>, used for the imperative,
and the participial -<i>menoi</i>, masculine, -<i>menai</i>, feminine, used with
the verb “to be” in place of the ordinary inflexions. Since these
forms had all come to have the same shape, through phonetic change,
their meanings were fused; the imperative forms being restricted
to the plural, and the participial forms being restricted to the second
person.
</p><p>31. <i>Past Participle Passive.</i>—Next should be mentioned the great
development in the use of the participle in -<i>tos</i> (<i>factus</i>, <i>fusus</i>, &amp;c.).
This participle was taken with <i>sum</i> to form the perfect tenses of the
passive, in which, thanks partly to the fusion of perfect and aorist
active, a past aorist sense was also evolved. This reacted on the
participle itself giving it a prevailingly past colour, but its originally
timeless use survives in many places, <i>e.g.</i> in the participle <i>ratus</i>,
which has as a rule no past sense, and more definitely still in such
passages as Vergil, <i>Georg.</i> i. 206 (<i>vectis</i>), <i>Aen.</i> vi. 22 (<i>ductis</i>), both of
which passages demand a present sense. It is to be noticed also that
in the earliest Latin, as in Greek and Sanskrit, the <i>passive</i> meaning,
though the commonest, is not universal. Many traces of this survive
in classical Latin, of which the chief are
</p>
<div style="text-indent: -2em;;padding-left:4em;">
<p>1. The active meaning of deponent participles, in spite of the
fact that some of them (<i>e.g.</i> <i>adeptus</i>, <i>ēmēnsus</i>, <i>expertus</i>) have
also a passive sense, and
</p><p>2. The familiar use of these participles by the Augustan poets
with an accusative attached (<i>galeam indutus</i>, <i>traiectus lora</i>).
Here no doubt the use of the Greek middle influenced the
Latin poets, but no doubt they thought also that they were
reviving an old Latin idiom.
</p>
</div>
<p>32. <i>Future Participle.</i>—Finally may be mentioned together (<i>a</i>) the
development of the future participle active (in -<i>ūrus</i>, never so freely
used as the other participles, being rare in the ablative absolute even
in Tacitus) from an old infinitive in -<i>ūrum</i> (“scio inimicos meos
hoc dicturum,” C. Gracchus (and others) <i>apud</i> Gell. 1. 7, and Priscian
ix. 864 (p. 475 Keil), which arose from combining the dative or
locative of the verbal noun in -<i>tu</i> with an old infinitive <i>esom</i> “esse”
which survives in Oscan, *<i>dictu esom</i> becoming <i>dicturum</i>. This was
discovered by J. P. Postgate (<i>Class. Review</i>, v. 301, and <i>Idg.</i>
<i>Forschungen</i> iv. 252). (<i>b</i>) From the same infinitival accusative with
the post-position -<i>dō</i>, meaning “to,” “for,” “in” (cf. <i>quandō</i> for
*<i>quam-do</i>, and Eng. <i>to</i>, Germ, <i>zu</i>) was formed the so-called gerund
<i>agen-dō</i>, “for doing,” “in doing,” which was taken for a Case, and
so gave rise to the accusative and genitive in -<i>dum</i> and -<i>dī</i>. The form
in -dō still lives in Italian as an indeclinable present participle. The
modal and purposive meanings of -<i>dō</i> appear in the uses of the gerund.
</p><p>The authorities giving a fuller account of Latin morphology are the
same as those cited in § 28 above, save that the reader must consult
the second volume of Brugmann’s <i>Grundriss</i>, which in the English
translation (by Conway and Rouse, Strassburg, 1890–1896) is
divided into volumes ii, iii. and iv.; and that Niedermann does not
deal with morphology.
</p>
<div class="tiInherit" style="text-align:center;">
<p>III. <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps">Syntax</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>The chief innovations of syntax developed in Latin may now be
briefly noted.
</p><p>33. <i>In nouns.</i>
</p><p>(i.) Latin restricted the various Cases to more sharply defined uses
than either Greek or Sanskrit; the free use of the internal accusative
in Greek (<i>e.g.</i> <span title="habròn baínein, typhlòs tà ō̂ta"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ἁβρὸν βαίνειν, τυφλὸς τὰ ὦτα</span></span>) is strange to Latin, save in
poetical imitations of Greek; and so is the freedom of the Sanskrit
instrumental, which often covers meanings expressed in Latin by
<i>cum</i>, <i>ab</i>, <i>inter</i>.
</p><p>(ii.) The syncretism of the so-called ablative case, which combines
the uses of (<i>a</i>) the true ablative which ended in -<i>d</i> (O. Lat. <i>praidād</i>);
(<i>b</i>) the instrumental sociative (plural forms like <i>dominīs</i>, the ending
being that of Sans. <i>çivāiş</i>); and (<i>c</i>) the locative (<i>noct-e</i>, “at night”;
<i>itiner-e</i>, “on the road,” with the ending of Greek <span title="elpid-i"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ἐλπίδ–ι</span></span>). The so-called
absolute construction is mainly derived from the second of
these, since it is regularly attached fairly closely to the subject of the
clause in which it stands, and when accompanied by a passive
participle most commonly denotes an action performed by that
subject. But the other two sources cannot be altogether excluded
(<i>orto sole</i>, “starting from sunrise”; <i>campo patente</i>, “on, in sight of,
the open plain”).
</p><p>34. <i>In verbs.</i>
</p><p>(i.) The rich development and fine discrimination of the uses of
the subjunctive mood, especially (<i>a</i>) in indirect questions (based on&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="250" data-page-number="250" data-page-name="Page:EB1911 - Volume 16.djvu/270" data-page-index="270" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_16.djvu/270"><span id="pageindex_270" class="pagenum-inner ws-noexport">&#8203;</span></span></span>direct deliberative questions and not fully developed by the time
of Plautus, who constantly writes such phrases as <i>dic quis es</i> for the
Ciceronian <i>dic quis sis</i>); (<i>b</i>) after the relative of essential definition
(<i>non is sum qui negem</i>) and the circumstantial <i>cum</i> (“at such a time
as that”). The two uses (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) with (<i>c</i>) the common Purpose
and Consequence-clauses spring from the “prospective” or “anticipatory”
meaning of the mood. (<i>d</i>) Observe further its use in subordinate
oblique clauses (<i>irascitur quod abierim</i>, “he is angry because,
<i>as he asserts</i>, I went away”). This and all the uses of the mood in
oratio obliqua are derived partly from (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) and partly from
the (<i>e</i>) Unreal Jussive of past time (<i>Non illi argentum redderem?</i>
<i>Non redderes</i>, “Ought I not to have returned the money to him?”
“You certainly ought not to have,” or, more literally, “You were not
to”).
</p><p>On this interesting chapter of Latin syntax see W. G. Hale’s “Cum-constructions”
(<i>Cornell University Studies in Classical Philology</i>,
No. 1, 1887–1889), and <i>The Anticipatory Subjunctive</i> (Chicago, 1894).
</p><p>(ii.) The complex system of oratio obliqua with the sequence of
tenses (on the growth of the latter see Conway, <i>Livy II.</i>, Appendix ii.,
Cambridge, 1901).
</p><p>(iii.) The curious construction of the gerundive (<i>ad capiendam</i>
<i>urbem</i>), originally a present (and future?) passive participle, but restricted
in its use by being linked with the so-called gerund (see § 32, <i>b</i>).
The use, but probably not the restriction, appears in Oscan and
Umbrian.
</p><p>(iv.) The favourite use of the impersonal passive has already been
mentioned (§ 5, iv.).
</p><p>35. The chief authorities for the study of Latin syntax are:
Brugmann’s <i>Kurze vergl. Grammatik</i>, vol. ii. (see § 28); Landgraf’s
<i>Historische lat. Syntax</i> (vol. ii. of the joint <i>Hist. Gram.</i>, see § 28);
Hale and Buck’s <i>Latin Grammar</i> (see § 28); Draeger’s <i>Historische</i>
<i>lat. Syntax</i>, 2 vols. (2nd ed., Leipzig, 1878–1881), useful but not
always trustworthy; the Latin sections in Delbrück’s <i>Vergleichende</i>
<i>Syntax</i>, being the third volume of Brugmann’s <i>Grundriss</i> (§ 28).

<p>IV. <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps">Importation of Greek Words</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>36. It is convenient, before proceeding to describe the development
of the language in its various epochs, to notice briefly
the debt of its vocabulary to Greek, since it affords an indication
of the steadily increasing influence of Greek life and literature
upon the growth of the younger idiom. Corssen (<i>Lat. Aussprache</i>,
ii. 814) pointed out four different stages in the process,
and though they are by no means sharply divided in time,
they do correspond to different degrees and kinds of intercourse.
</p>
<div style="font-size: 92%; line-height: 1.3em">
<p>(<i>a</i>) The first represents the period of the early intercourse of Rome
with the Greek states, especially with the colonies in the south of
Italy and Sicily. To this stage belong many names of nations,
countries and towns, as <i>Siculi</i>, <i>Tarentum</i>, <i>Graeci</i>, <i>Achivi</i>, <i>Poenus</i>;
and also names of weights and measures, articles of industry and
terms connected with navigation, as <i>mina</i>, <i>talentum</i>, <i>purpura</i>,
<i>patina</i>, <i>ancora</i>, <i>aplustre</i>, <i>nausea</i>. Words like <i>amurca</i>, <i>scutula</i>,
<i>pessulus</i>, <i>balineum</i>, <i>tarpessita</i> represent familiarity with Greek
customs and bear equally the mark of naturalization. To these
may be added names of gods or heroes, like <i>Apollo</i>, <i>Pollux</i> and
perhaps <i>Hercules</i>. These all became naturalized Latin words and
were modified by the phonetic changes which took place in the Latin
language after they had come into it (cf. §§ 9-27 <i>supra</i>). (<i>b</i>) The
second stage was probably the result of the closer intercourse resulting
from the conquest of southern Italy, and the wars in Sicily,
and of the contemporary introduction of imitations of Greek literature
into Rome, with its numerous references to Greek life and
culture. It is marked by the free use of hybrid forms, whether made
by the addition of Latin suffixes to Greek stems as <i>ballistārius</i>,
<i>hēpatārius</i>, <i>subbasilicānus</i>, <i>s<span style="text-decoration: overline">y</span>cophantiōsus</i>, <i>cōmissārī</i> or of Greek
suffixes to Latin stems as <i>plāgipatidas</i>, <i>pernōnides</i>; or by derivation,
as <i>thermopōtāre</i>, <i>supparasītāri</i>; or by composition as <i>ineuschēmē</i>,
<i>thyrsigerae</i>, <i>flagritribae</i>, <i>scrophipascī</i>. The character of many of
these words shows that the comic poets who coined them must have
been able to calculate upon a fair knowledge of colloquial Greek on
the part of a considerable portion of their audience. The most
remarkable instance of this is supplied by the burlesque lines in
Plautus (<i>Pers.</i> 702 seq.), where Sagaristio describes himself as
</p>

Quodsemelarripides, Nunquameripides.
</p>
</div>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>During this period Greek words are still generally inflected according
to the Latin usage.
</p><p>(<i>c</i>) But with Accius (see below) begins a third stage, in which the
Greek inflexion is frequently preserved, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Hectora</i>, <i>Oresten</i>, <i>Cithaeron</i>;
and from this time forward the practice wavers. Cicero
generally prefers the Latin case-endings, defending, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Piraeeum</i> as
against <i>Piraeea</i> (<i>ad Att.</i> vii. 3, 7), but not without some fluctuation,
while Varro takes the opposite side, and prefers <i>poëmasin</i> to the
Ciceronian <i>poëmatis</i>. By this time also <i>y</i> and <i>z</i> were introduced, and
the representation of the Greek aspirates by <i>th</i>, <i>ph</i>, <i>ch</i>, so that words
newly borrowed from the Greek could be more faithfully reproduced.
This is equally true whatever was the precise nature of the sound
which at that period the Greek aspirates had reached in their secular
process of change from pure aspirates (as in Eng. <i>ant-hill</i>, &amp;c.) to
fricatives (like Eng. <i>th</i> in <i>thin</i>). (See Arnold and Conway, <i>The</i>
<i>Restored Pronunciation of Greek and Latin</i>, 4th ed., Cambridge,
1908, p. 21.)
</p><p>(<i>d</i>) A fourth stage is marked by the practice of the Augustan
poets, who, especially when writing in imitation of Greek originals,
freely use the Greek inflexions, such as <i>Arcaděs</i>, <i>Tethŷ</i>, <i>Aegida</i>,
<i>Echūs</i>, &amp;c. Horace probably always used the Latin form in his
<i>Satires</i> and <i>Epistles</i>, the Greek in his Odes. Later prose writers for
the most part followed the example of his <i>Odes</i>. It must be added,
however, in regard to these literary borrowings that it is not quite
clear whether in this fourth class, and even in the unmodified forms
in the preceding class, the words had really any living use in
spoken Latin.

<p>This appears the proper place for a rapid survey of the pronunciation<sup id="cite_ref-f1_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-f1-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>
of the Latin language, as spoken in its best days.
</p><p>37. <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps">Consonants.</span>—(i.) <i>Back palatal.</i> Breathed plosive <i>c</i>, pronounced
always as <i>k</i> (except that in some early inscriptions—probably
none much later, if at all later, than 300 <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span>—the character
is used also for <i>g</i>) until about the 7th century after Christ. <i>K</i>
went out of use at an early period, except in a few old abbreviations
for words in which it had stood before <i>a</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>kal.</i> for <i>kalendae</i>. <i>Q</i>,
always followed by the consonantal <i>u</i>, except in a few old inscriptions,
in which it is used for <i>c</i> before the vowel <i>u</i>, <i>e.g.</i> <i>pequnia</i>. <i>X</i>,
an abbreviation for <i>cs</i>; <i>xs</i> is, however, sometimes found. Voiced
plosive <i>g</i>, pronounced as in English <i>gone</i>, but never as in English
<i>gem</i> before about the 6th century after Christ. Aspirate <i>h</i>, the rough
breathing as in English.
</p><p>(ii.) <i>Palatal.</i>—The consonantal <i>i</i>, like the English <i>y</i>; it is only
in late inscriptions that we find, in spellings like <i>Zanuario</i>, <i>Giove</i>,
any definite indication of a pronunciation like the English <i>j</i>. The
precise date of the change is difficult to determine (see Lindsay’s
<i>Latin Lang.</i> p. 49), especially as we may, in isolated cases, have before
us merely a dialectic variation; see <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps"><a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Paeligni" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Paeligni">Paeligni</a></span>.

found in the transcription of Greek words in and after the time of
Cicero, as <i>dz</i> or <i>zz</i>.

English; but by the end of the 4th century <i>di</i> before a vowel was
pronounced like our <i>j</i> (cf. <i>diurnal</i> and <i>journal</i>). Nasal, <i>n</i> as in
English; but also (like the English <i>n</i>) a guttural nasal (<i>ng</i>) before a
guttural. Apparently it was very lightly pronounced, and easily
fell away before <i>s</i>.

English; but occasionally in inscriptions of the later empire <i>v</i> is
written for <i>b</i>, showing that in some cases <i>b</i> had already acquired the

time of Plautus and probably much later, and which for practical
use in teaching have been proved far the best.

<p>VI. <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps">The Language as recorded</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>39. Passing now to a survey of the condition of the language
at various epochs and in the different authors, we find the
earliest monument of it yet discovered in a donative inscription
on a fibula or brooch found in a tomb of the 7th century <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span>
at Praeneste. It runs “Manios med fhefhaked Numasioi,”
<i>i.e.</i> “Manios made me for Numasios.” The use of <i>f</i> (<i>fh</i>) to denote
the sound of Latin <i>f</i> supplied the explanation of the change of
the symbol <i>f</i> from its Greek value (&#160;=&#160;Eng. <i>w</i>) to its Latin value
<i>f</i>, and shows the Chalcidian Greek alphabet in process of adaptation
to the needs of Latin (see <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps"><a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Writing" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Writing">Writing</a></span>). The reduplicated
perfect, its 3rd sing. ending -<i>ed</i>, the dative masculine in -<i>oi</i>
(this is one of the only two recorded examples in Latin), the
-<i>s</i>- between vowels (§ 25, 1), and the -<i>a</i>- in what was then (see
§§ 9, 10) certainly an unaccented syllable and the accusative
<i>med</i>, are all interesting marks of antiquity.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>40. The next oldest fragment of continuous Latin is furnished
by a vessel dug up in the valley between the Quirinal and the
Viminal early in 1880. The vessel is of a dark brown clay, and
consists of three small round pots, the sides of which are connected
together. All round this vessel runs an inscription,
in three clauses, two nearly continuous, the third written below;
the writing is from right to left, and is still clearly legible; the
characters include one sign not belonging to the later Latin
alphabet, namely <a href="/wiki/File:EB1911Alphabet-pict59.png" class="image"><img alt="EB1911Alphabet-pict59.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/EB1911Alphabet-pict59.png/12px-EB1911Alphabet-pict59.png" decoding="async" width="12" height="14" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/EB1911Alphabet-pict59.png 1.5x" data-file-width="15" data-file-height="18" /></a> for R, while the M has five strokes and the
Q has the form of a Koppa.
</p><p>The inscription is as follows:—
</p>
<div style="font-size: 92%; line-height: 1.3em">
<p>“iovesat deivos qoi med mitat, nei ted endo cosmis virco sied, asted
noisi opetoitesiai pacari vois.
</p><p>dvenos med feced en manom einom duenoi ne med malo statod.”
</p>
</div>
<p>The general style of the writing and the phonetic peculiarities
make it fairly certain that this work must have been produced
not later than 300 <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span> Some points in its interpretation are
still open to doubt,<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> but the probable interpretation is—
</p>
<div style="font-size: 92%; line-height: 1.3em">
<p>“Deos iurat ille (<i>or</i> iurant illi) qui me mittat (<i>or</i> mittant) ne in te
Virgo (<i>i.e.</i> Proserpina) comis sit, nisi quidem optimo (?) Theseae (?)
pacari vis. Duenos me fecit contra Manum, Dueno autem ne per me
malum stato (&#160;=&#160;imputetur, imponatur).”
</p>
</div>
<p>“He (or they) who dispatch me binds the gods (by his offering)
that Proserpine shall not be kind to thee unless thou wilt
make terms with (or “for”) Opetos Thesias (?). Duenos
made me against Manus, but let no evil fall to Duenos on my
account.”
</p><p>41. Between these two inscriptions lies in point of date the
famous stele discovered in the Forum in 1899 (G. Boni, <i>Notiz.</i>
<i>d. scavi</i>, May 1899). The upper half had been cut off in order
to make way for a new pavement or black stone blocks (known
to archaeologists as the <i>niger lapis</i>) on the site of the comitium,
just to the north-east of the Forum in front of the Senate House.
The inscription was written lengthwise along the (pyramidal)
stele from foot to apex, but with the alternate lines in reverse
directions, and one line not on the full face of any one of the four
sides, but up a roughly-flattened fifth side made by slightly
broadening one of the angles. No single sentence is complete
and the mutilated fragments have given rise to a whole literature
of conjectural “restorations.”

<p>R. S. Conway examined it <i>in situ</i> in company with F. Skutsch in
1903 (cf. his article in Vollmöller’s <i>Jahresbericht</i>, vi. 453), and the
only words that can be regarded as reasonably certain are <i>regei</i>
(<i>regi</i>) on face 2, <i>kalatorem</i> and <i>iouxmenta</i> on face 3, and <i>iouestod</i>
(<i>iusto</i>) on face 4.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> The date may be said to be fixed by the variation of

indications which suggest the 5th century <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span> It has been suggested
also that the reason for the destruction of the stele and the repavement
may have been either (1) the pollution of the comitium by the
Gallic invasion of 390 <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span>, all traces of which, on their departure,
could be best removed by a repaving; or (2) perhaps more probably,
the Augustan restorations (Studniczka, <i>Jahresheft d. Österr. Institut</i>,
1903, vi. 129 ff.).
<span style="float:right;">&#160;(<a href="/wiki/Author:Robert_Seymour_Conway" title="Author:Robert Seymour Conway"><span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps">R. S. C.</span></a>)&#8193;</span>
</p>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
<p>42. Of the earlier long inscriptions the most important would be
the <i>Columna Rostrata</i>, or column of <a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Duilius,_Gaius" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Duilius, Gaius">Gaius Duilius</a> (<i>q.v.</i>), erected to
commemorate his victory over the Carthaginians in 260 <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span>, but for
the extent to which it has suffered from the hands of restorers.
The shape of the letters plainly shows that the inscription, as we
have it, was cut in the time of the empire. Hence Ritschl and
Mommsen pointed out that the language was modified at the same
time, and that, although many archaisms have been retained, some
were falsely introduced, and others replaced by more modern forms.
The most noteworthy features in it are—C always written for G
(<span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps">Ceset</span> = <i>gessit</i>), single for double consonants (<i>clases-classes</i>), <i>d</i>
retained in the ablative (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>in altod marid</i>), <i>o</i> for <i>u</i> in inflexions
(<i>primos</i>, <i>exfociont</i> = <i>exfugiunt</i>), <i>e</i> for <i>i</i> (<i>navebos</i> = <i>navibus</i>, <i>exemet</i> =
<i>exemit</i>); of these the first is probably an affected archaism, G
having been introduced some time before the assumed date of the
inscription. On the other hand, we have <i>praeda</i> where we should
have expected <i>praida</i>; no final consonants are dropped; and the
forms -<i>es</i>, -<i>eis</i> and -<i>is</i> for the accusative plural are interchanged
capriciously. The doubts hence arising preclude the possibility of
using it with confidence as evidence for the state of the language in
the 3rd century <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span>
</p><p>43. Of unquestionable genuineness and the greatest value are the
<i>Scipionum Elogia</i>, inscribed on stone coffins, found in the monument
of the Scipios outside the Capene gate (<i>C.I.L.</i><sup>1</sup> i. 32). The earliest
of the family whose epitaph has been preserved is L. Cornelius Scipio
Barbatus (consul 298 <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span>), the latest C. Cornelius Scipio Hispanus
(praetor in 139 <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span>); but there are good reasons for believing with
Ritschl that the epitaph of the first was not contemporary, but was
somewhat later than that of his son (consul 259 <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span>). This last may
therefore be taken as the earliest specimen of any length of Latin
and it was written at Rome; it runs as <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r9031029"/><span class="nowrap">follows:—</span>

<p>The archaisms in this inscription are—(1) the retention of <i>o</i> for <i>u</i>
in the inflexion of both nouns and verbs; (2) the diphthongs <i>oi</i>
(&#160;=&#160;later <i>u</i>) and <i>ai</i> (&#160;=&#160;later <i>ae</i>); (3) -<i>et</i> for -<i>it</i>, <i>hec</i> for <i>hic</i>, and -<i>ebus</i>
for -<i>ibus</i>; (4) <i>duon</i>- for <i>bon</i>; and (5) the dropping of a final <i>m</i> in every
case except in <i>Luciom</i>, a variation which is a marked characteristic
of the language of this period.
</p><p>44. The oldest specimen of the Latin language preserved to us
in any literary source is to be found in two fragments of the Carmina
Saliaria (Varro, <i>De ling. Lat.</i> vii. 26, 27), and one in Terentianus
Scaurus, but they are unfortunately so corrupt as to give us little
real information (see B. Maurenbrecher, <i>Carminum Saliarium</i>
<i>reliquiae</i>, Leipzig, 1894; G. Hempl, <i>American Philol. Assoc.</i>
<i>Transactions</i>, xxxi., 1900, 184). Rather better evidence is supplied
in the <i>Carmen Fratrum Arvalium</i>, which was found in 1778 engraved
on one of the numerous tablets recording the transactions of the
college of the Arval brothers, dug up on the site of their grove by
the Tiber, 5 m. from the city of Rome; but this also has been so
corrupted in its oral tradition that even its general meaning is by
no means clear (<i>C.I.L.</i><sup>1</sup> i. 28; Jordan, <i>Krit. Beiträge</i>, pp. 203-211).
</p>
</div>
<p>45. The text of the Twelve Tables (451–450 <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span>), if preserved
in its integrity, would have been invaluable as a record of antique
Latin; but it is known to us only in quotations. R. Schoell,
whose edition and commentary (Leipzig, 1866) is the most
complete, notes the following traces, among others, of an archaic
syntax: (1) both the subject and the object of the verb are often
left to be understood from the context, <i>e.g. ni it antestamino</i>,
<i>igitur</i>, <i>em capito</i>; (2) the imperative is used even for permissions,
“si volet, plus dato,” “if he choose, he may give him more”;
(3) the subjunctive is apparently never used in conditional,&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="252" data-page-number="252" data-page-name="Page:EB1911 - Volume 16.djvu/272" data-page-index="272" data-page-quality="4" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_16.djvu/272"><span id="pageindex_272" class="pagenum-inner ws-noexport">&#8203;</span></span></span>only in final sentences, but the future perfect is common; (4)
the connexion between sentences is of the simplest kind, and
conjunctions are rare. There are, of course, numerous isolated
archaisms of form and meaning, such as <i>calvitur</i>, <i>pacunt</i>, <i>endo</i>,
<i>escit</i>. Later and less elaborate editions are contained in <i>Fontes</i>
<i>Iuris Romani</i>, by Bruns-Mommsen-Gradenwitz (1892); and
P. Girard, <i>Textes de droit romain</i> (1895).
</p><p>46. Turning now to the language of literature we may group
the Latin authors as follows:—<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>I. <i>Ante-Classical</i> (240–80 <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span>).—Naevius (? 269–204), Plautus
(254–184), Ennius (239–169), Cato the Elder (234–149), Terentius
(? 195–159), Pacuvius (220–132), Accius (170–94), Lucilius
(? 168–103).
</p><p>II. <i>Classical—Golden Age</i> (80 <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span>–<span style="font-size: 83%;">A.D.</span> 14).—Varro (116–28),
Cicero (106–44), Lucretius (99–55), Caesar (102–44), Catullus
(87–? 47), Sallust (86–34), Virgil (70–19), Horace (65–8), Propertius
(? 50–&#160;?), Tibullus (? 54–? 18), Ovid (43 <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span>–<span style="font-size: 83%;">A.D.</span> 18),
Livy (59 <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span>–<span style="font-size: 83%;">A.D.</span> 18).
</p><p>III. <i>Classical—Silver Age</i> (<span style="font-size: 83%;">A.D.</span> 14–180).—Velleius (? 19 <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span>–?
<span style="font-size: 83%;">A.D.</span> 31), M. Seneca (d. <i>c.</i> <span style="font-size: 83%;">A.D.</span> 30), Persius (34–62), Petronius
(d. 66), Lucan (39–65), L. Seneca (d. <span style="font-size: 83%;">A.D.</span> 65), Plinius major
(23–<span style="font-size: 83%;">A.D.</span> 79), Martial (40–101), Quintilian (42–118), Pliny the
Younger (61–? 113), Tacitus (? 60–? 118), Juvenal (? 47–? 138),
Suetonius (75–160), Fronto (<i>c.</i> 90–170).
</p><p>47. <i>Naevius and Plautus.</i>—In Naevius we find archaisms
proportionally much more numerous than in Plautus, especially
in the retention of the original length of vowels, and early forms
of inflexion, such as the genitive in -<i>as</i> and the ablative in -<i>d</i>.
The number of archaic words preserved is perhaps due to the fact
that so large a proportion of his fragments have been preserved
only by the grammarians, who cited them for the express purpose
of explaining these.
</p><p>Of the language of Plautus important features have already
been mentioned (§§ 10-16); for its more general characteristics
see <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps"><a href="/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Plautus,_Titus_Maccius" title="1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Plautus, Titus Maccius">Plautus</a></span>.
</p><p>48. <i>Ennius.</i>—The language of Ennius deserves especial study
because of the immense influence which he exerted in fixing the
literary style. He first established the rule that in hexameter
verse all vowels followed by two consonants (except in the case
of a mute and a liquid), or a double consonant, must be treated
as lengthened by position. The number of varying quantities
is also much diminished, and the elision of final -<i>m</i> becomes the
rule, though not without exceptions. On the other hand he very
commonly retains the original length of verbal terminations
(<i>essēt</i>, <i>faciēt</i>) and of nominatives in <i>or</i> and <i>a</i>, and elides final
<i>s</i> before an initial consonant. In declension he never uses -<i>ae</i>
as the genitive, but -<i>ai</i> or -<i>as</i>; the older and shorter form of the
gen. plur. is -<i>um</i> in common; obsolete forms of pronouns are
used, as <i>mis</i>, <i>olli</i>, <i>sum</i> (= eum), <i>sas</i>, <i>sos</i>, <i>sapsa</i>; and in verbal
inflexion there are old forms like <i>morīmur</i> (§ 15), <i>fūimus</i> (§ 17, vi.),
<i>potestur</i> (cf. § 5, iv.). Some experiments in the way of tmesis
(<i>saxo</i> cere <i>comminuit</i>-brum) and apocope (<i>divum domus altisonum</i>
cael, <i>replet te laetificum</i> gau) were happily regarded as failures,
and never came into real use. His syntax is simple and straightforward,
with the occasional pleonasms of a rude style, and conjunctions
are comparatively rare. From this time forward the
literary language of Rome parted company with the popular
dialect. Even to the classical writers Latin was in a certain
sense a dead language. Its vocabulary was not identical with
that of ordinary life. Now and again a writer would lend new
vigour to his style by phrases and constructions drawn from
homely speech. But on the whole, and in ever-increasing
measure, the language of literature was the language of the
schools, adapted to foreign models. The genuine current of
Italian speech is almost lost to view with Plautus and Terence,
and reappears clearly only in the semi-barbarous products of
the early Romance literature.
</p><p>49. <i>Pacuvius, Accius and Lucilius.</i>—Pacuvius is noteworthy
especially for his attempt to introduce a free use of compounds
after the fashion of the Greek, which were felt in the classical
times to be unsuited to the genius of the Latin language,
Quintilian censures severely his <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r9031029"/><span class="nowrap">line—</span>
</p>
<div class="tiInherit" style="text-align:center;">
<div style="font-size: 92%; line-height: 1.3em">
<p>Nerei repandirostrum incurvicervicum pecus.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Accius, though probably the greatest of the Roman tragedians,
is only preserved in comparatively unimportant fragments.
We know that he paid much attention to grammar and orthography;
and his language is much more finished than that of
Ennius. It shows no marked archaisms of form, unless the
infinitive in -<i>ier</i> is to be accounted as such.
</p><p>Lucilius furnishes a specimen of the language of the period,
free from the restraints of tragic diction and the imitation of
Greek originals. Unfortunately the greater part of his fragments
are preserved only by a grammarian whose text is exceptionally
corrupt; but they leave no doubt as to the justice of the criticism
passed by Horace on his careless and “muddy” diction. The
<i>urbanitas</i> which is with one accord conceded to him by ancient
critics seems to indicate that his style was free from the taint of
provincial Latinity, and it may be regarded as reproducing the
language of educated circles in ordinary life; the numerous
Graecisms and Greek quotations with which it abounds show the
familiarity of his readers with the Greek language and literature.
Varro ascribes to him the <i>gracile genus dicendi</i>, the distinguishing
features of which were <i>venustas</i> and <i>subtilitas</i>. Hence it appears
that his numerous archaisms were regarded as in no way inconsistent
with grace and precision of diction. But it may be
remembered that Varro was himself something of an archaizer,
and also that the grammarians’ quotations may bring this aspect
too much into prominence. Lucilius shares with the comic poets
the use of many plebeian expressions, the love for diminutives,
abstract terms and words of abuse; but occasionally he borrows
from the more elevated style of Ennius forms like <i>simitu</i> (= simul),
<i>noenu</i> (= non), <i>facul</i> (= facile), and the genitive in -<i>āī</i>, and he
ridicules the contemporary tragedians for their <i>zetematia</i>, their
high-flown diction and <i>sesquipedalia verba</i>, which make the
characters talk “not like men but like portents, flying winged
snakes.” In his ninth book he discusses questions of grammar,
and gives some interesting facts as to the tendencies of the
language. For instance, when he ridicules a <i>praetor urbanus</i>
for calling himself <i>pretor</i>, we see already the intrusion of the
rustic degradation of <i>ae</i> into <i>e</i>, which afterwards became universal.
He shows a great command of technical language, and (partly
owing to the nature of the fragments) <span title="hápax legómena"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ἅπαξ λεγόμενα</span></span> are very
numerous.
</p><p>50. <i>Cato.</i>—The treatise of Cato the elder, <i>De re rustica</i>,
would have afforded invaluable material, but it has unfortunately
come down to us in a text greatly modernized, which is more of
interest from the point of view of literature than of language.
We find in it, however, instances of the accusative with <i>uti</i>, of
the old imperative <i>praefamino</i> and of the fut. sub. <i>servassis</i>,
<i>prohibessis</i> and such interesting subjunctive constructions as
<i>dato bubus bibant omnibus</i>, “give all the oxen (water) to drink.”
</p><p>51. <i>Growth of Latin Prose.</i>—It is unfortunately impossible to
trace the growth of Latin prose diction through its several stages
with the same clearness as in the case of poetry. The fragments
of the earlier Latin prose writers are too scanty for us to be
able to say with certainty when and how a formed prose style
was created. But the impulse to it was undoubtedly given in
the habitual practice of oratory. The earliest orators, like
Cato, were distinguished for strong common sense, biting wit
and vigorous language, rather than for any graces of style; and
probably personal <i>auctoritas</i> was of far more account than rhetoric
both in the law courts and in the assemblies of the people. The
first public speaker, according to Cicero, who aimed at a polished
style and elaborate periods was M. Aemilius Lepidus Porcina,
in the middle of the 2nd century <span style="font-size: 83%;">B.C.</span><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> On his model the Gracchi
and Carbo fashioned themselves, and, if we may judge from the
fragments of the orations of C. Gracchus which are preserved,
there were few traces of archaism remaining. A more perfect
example of the <i>urbanitas</i> at which good speakers aimed was
supplied by a famous speech of C. Fannius against C. Gracchus,&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="253" data-page-number="253" data-page-name="Page:EB1911 - Volume 16.djvu/273" data-page-index="273" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_16.djvu/273"><span id="pageindex_273" class="pagenum-inner ws-noexport">&#8203;</span></span></span>which Cicero considered the best oration of the time. No small
part of the <i>urbanitas</i> consisted in a correct urban pronunciation;
and the standard of this was found in the language of the women
of the upper classes, such as Laelia and Cornelia.
</p><p>In the earliest continuous prose work which remains to us
the four books <i>De Rhetorica ad Herennium</i>, we find the language
already almost indistinguishable from that of Cicero. There has
been much discussion as to the authorship of this work, now
commonly, without very convincing reasons, ascribed to Q. Cornificius;
but, among the numerous arguments which prove that
it cannot have been the work of Cicero, none has been adduced
of any importance drawn from the character of the language.
It is worth while noticing that not only is the style in itself
perfectly finished, but the treatment of the subject of style,
<i>elocutio</i> (iv. 12. 17), shows the pains which had already been
given to the question. The writer lays down three chief requisites—(1)
<i>elegantia</i>, (2) <i>compositio</i> and (3) <i>dignitas</i>. Under
the first come <i>Latinitas</i>, a due avoidance of solecisms and barbarisms,
and <i>explanatio</i>, clearness, the employment of familiar and
appropriate expressions. The second demands a proper arrangement;
hiatus, alliteration, rhyme, the repetition or displacement
of words, and too long sentences are all to be eschewed. Dignity
depends upon the selection of language and of sentiments.
</p><p>52. <i>Characteristics of Latin Prose.</i>—Hence we see that by the
time of Cicero Latin prose was fully developed. We may, therefore,
pause here to notice the characteristic qualities of the
language at its most perfect stage. The Latin critics were
themselves fully conscious of the broad distinction in character
between their own language and the Greek. Seneca dwells
upon the stately and dignified movement of the Latin period,
and uses for Cicero the happy epithet of <i>gradarius</i>. He allows
to the Greeks <i>gratia</i>, but claims <i>potentia</i> for his own countrymen.
Quintilian (xii. 10. 27 seq.) concedes to Greek more euphony and
variety both of vocalization and of accent; he admits that
Latin words are harsher in sound, and often less happily adapted
to the expression of varying shades of meaning. But he too
claims “power” as the distinguishing mark of his own language.
Feeble thought may be carried off by the exquisite harmony and
subtleness of Greek diction; his countrymen must aim at fulness
and weight of ideas if they are not to be beaten off the field.
The Greek authors are like lightly moving skiffs; the Romans
spread wider sails and are wafted by stronger breezes; hence
the deeper waters suit them. It is not that the Latin language
fails to respond to the calls made upon it. Lucretius and Cicero
concur, it is true, in complaints of the poverty of their native
language; but this was only because they had had no predecessors
in the task of adapting it to philosophic utterance;
and the long life of Latin technical terms like <i>qualitas</i>, <i>species</i>,
<i>genus</i>, <i>ratio</i>, shows how well the need was met when it arose.
H. A. J. Munro has said admirably of this very period:—
</p>
<div style="font-size: 92%; line-height: 1.3em">
<p>“The living Latin for all the higher forms of composition, both
prose and verse, was a far nobler language than the living Greek.
During the long period of Grecian pre-eminence and literary glory,
from Homer to Demosthenes, all the manifold forms of poetry and
prose which were invented one after the other were brought to such
exquisite perfection that their beauty of form and grace of language
were never afterwards rivalled by Latin or any other people. But
hardly had Demosthenes and Aristotle ceased to live when that
Attic which had been gradually formed into such a noble instrument
of thought in the hands of Aristophanes, Euripides, Plato and the
orators, and had superseded for general use all the other dialects,
became at the same time the language of the civilized world and was
stricken with a mortal decay.... Epicurus, who was born in the
same year as Menander, writes a harsh jargon that does not deserve
to be called a style; and others of whose writings anything is left
entire or in fragments, historians and philosophers alike, Polybius,
Chrysippus, Philodemus, are little if any better. When Cicero deigns
to translate any of their sentences, see what grace and life he instils
into their clumsily expressed thoughts, how satisfying to the ear and
taste are the periods of Livy when he is putting into Latin the heavy
and uncouth clauses of Polybius! This may explain what Cicero
means when at one time he gives to Greek the preference over
Latin, at another to Latin over Greek; in reading Sophocles or
Plato he could acknowledge their unrivalled excellence; in translating
Panaetius or Philodemus he would feel his own immeasurable
superiority.”
</p>
</div>
<p>The greater number of long syllables, combined with the
paucity of diphthongs and the consequent monotony of vocalization,
and the uniformity of the accent, lent a weight and dignity of
movement to the language which well suited the national <i>gravitas</i>.
The precision of grammatical rules and the entire absence of
dialectic forms from the written literature contributed to maintain
the character of unity which marked the Roman republic as compared
with the multiplicity of Greek states. It was remarked by
Francis Bacon that artistic and imaginative nations indulge freely
in verbal compounds, practical nations in simple concrete terms.
In this respect, too, Latin contrasts with Greek. The attempts
made by some of the earlier poets to indulge in novel compounds
was felt to be out of harmony with the genius of the language.
Composition, though necessarily employed, was kept within
narrow limits, and the words thus produced have a sharply
defined meaning, wholly unlike the poetical vagueness of some
of the Greek compounds. The vocabulary of the language, though
receiving accessions from time to time in accordance with practical
needs, was rarely enriched by the products of a spontaneous
creativeness. In literature the taste of the educated town
circles gave the law; and these, trained in the study of the Greek
masters of style, required something which should reproduce
for them the harmony of the Greek period. Happily the orators
who gave form to Latin prose were able to meet the demand
without departing from the spirit of their own language.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>53. <i>Cicero and Caesar.</i>—To Cicero especially the Romans
owed the realization of what was possible to their language
in the way of artistic finish of style. He represents a protest
at one and the same time against the inroads of the <i>plebeius</i>
<i>sermo</i>, vulgarized by the constant influx of non-Italian provincials
into Rome, and the “jargon of spurious and partial culture”
in vogue among the Roman pupils of the Asiatic rhetoricians.
His essential service was to have caught the tone and style of
the true Roman <i>urbanitas</i>, and to have fixed it in extensive and
widely read speeches and treatises as the final model of classical
prose. The influence of Caesar was wholly in the same direction.
His cardinal principle was that every new-fangled and affected
expression, from whatever quarter it might come, should be
avoided by the writer, as rocks by the mariner. His own style
for straightforward simplicity and purity has never been surpassed;
and it is not without full reason that Cicero and Caesar
are regarded as the models of classical prose. But, while they
fixed the type of the best Latin, they did not and could not alter
its essential character. In subtlety, in suggestiveness, in many-sided
grace and versatility, it remained far inferior to the Greek.
But for dignity and force, for cadence and rhythm, for clearness
and precision, the best Latin prose remains unrivalled.
</p><p>It is needless to dwell upon the grammar or vocabulary of
Cicero. His language is universally taken as the normal type of
Latin; and, as hitherto the history of the language has been
traced by marking differences from his usage, so the same method
may be followed for what remains.
</p><p>54. <i>Varro</i>, “the most learned of the ancients,” a friend and
contemporary of Cicero, seems to have rejected the periodic
rhythmical style of Cicero, and to have fallen back upon a more
archaic structure. Mommsen says of one passage “the clauses
of the sentence are arranged on the thread of the relative like
dead thrushes on a string.” But, in spite (some would say,
because) of his old-fashioned tendencies, his language shows
great vigour and spirit. In his Menippean satires he intentionally
made free use of plebeian expressions, while rising at times to
a real grace and showing often fresh humour. His treatise <i>De Re</i>
<i>Rustica</i>, in the form of a dialogue, is the most agreeable of his
works, and where the nature of his subject allows it there is&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="254" data-page-number="254" data-page-name="Page:EB1911 - Volume 16.djvu/274" data-page-index="274" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_16.djvu/274"><span id="pageindex_274" class="pagenum-inner ws-noexport">&#8203;</span></span></span>much vivacity and dramatic picturesqueness, although the
precepts are necessarily given in a terse and abrupt form. His
sentences are as a rule co-ordinated, with but few connecting
links; his diction contains many antiquated or unique words.
</p><p>55. <i>Sallust.</i>—In Sallust, a younger contemporary of Cicero,
we have the earliest complete specimen of historical narrative.
It is probably due to his subject-matter, at least in part, that his
style is marked by frequent archaisms; but something must
be ascribed to intentional imitation of the earlier chroniclers,
which led him to be called <i>priscorum Catonisque verborum</i>
<i>ineruditissimus fur</i>. His archaisms consist partly of words and
phrases used in a sense for which we have only early authorities,
<i>e.g.</i> <i>cum animo habere</i>, &amp;c., <i>animos tollere</i>, <i>bene factum</i>, <i>consultor</i>,
<i>prosapia</i>, <i>dolus</i>, <i>venenum</i>, <i>obsequela</i>, <i>inquies</i>, <i>sallere</i>, <i>occipere</i>,
<i>collibeo</i>, and the like, where we may notice especially the fondness
for frequentatives, which he shares with the early comedy;
partly in inflections which were growing obsolete, such as <i>senati</i>,
<i>solui</i>, <i>comperior</i> (dep.), <i>neglegisset</i>, <i>vis</i> (acc. pl.) <i>nequitur</i>. In
syntax his constructions are for the most part those of the
contemporary writers.
</p><p>56. <i>Lucretius</i> is largely archaic in his style. We find <i>im</i> for
<i>eum</i>, <i>endo</i> for <i>in</i>, <i>illae</i>, <i>ullae</i>, <i>unae</i> and <i>aliae</i> as genitives, <i>alid</i>
for <i>aliud</i>, <i>rabies</i> as a genitive by the side of genitives in -<i>ai</i>,
ablatives in -<i>i</i> like <i>colli</i>, <i>orbi</i>, <i>parti</i>, nominatives in <i>s</i> for <i>r</i>, like
<i>colos</i>, <i>vapos</i>, <i>humos</i>. In verbs there are <i>scatit</i>, <i>fulgit</i>, <i>quaesit</i>,
<i>confluxet</i> = <i>confluxisset</i>, <i>recesse</i> = <i>recessisse</i>, <i>induiacere</i> for <i>inicere</i>;
simple forms like <i>fligere</i>, <i>lacere</i>, <i>cedere</i>, <i>stinguere</i> for the more
usual compounds, the infinitive passive in -<i>ier</i>, and archaic
forms from <i>esse</i> like <i>siet</i>, <i>escit</i>, <i>fuat</i>. Sometimes he indulges
in tmesis which reminds us of Ennius: <i>inque pediri</i>, <i>disque</i>
<i>supata</i>, <i>ordia prima</i>. But this archaic tinge is adopted only for
poetical purposes, and as a proof of his devotion to the earlier
masters of his art; it does not affect the general substance of
his style, which is of the freshest and most vigorous stamp.
But the purity of his idiom is not gained by any slavish adherence
to a recognized vocabulary: he coins words freely; Munro
has noted more than a hundred <span title="hapax legomena"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ἅπαξ λεγόμενα</span></span>, or words which
he alone among good writers uses. Many of these are formed
on familiar models, such as compounds and frequentatives;
others are directly borrowed from the Greek apparently with a
view to sweetness of rhythm (ii. 412, v. 334, 505); others again
(forty or more in number) are compounds of a kind which
the classical language refused to adopt, such as <i>silvifragus</i>,
<i>terriloquus</i>, <i>perterricrepus</i>. He represents not so much a stage
in the history of the language as a protest against the tendencies
fashionable in his own time. But his influence was deep upon
Virgil, and through him upon all subsequent Latin literature.
</p><p>57. <i>Catullus</i> gives us the type of the language of the cultivated
circles, lifted into poetry by the simple directness with which
it is used to express emotion. In his heroic and elegiac poems
he did not escape the influence of the Alexandrian school, and
his genius is ill suited for long-continued flights; but in his
lyrical poems his language is altogether perfect. As Macaulay
says: “No Latin writer is so Greek. The simplicity, the pathos,
the perfect grace, which I find in the great Athenian models are
all in Catullus, and in him alone of the Romans.” The language
of these poems comes nearest perhaps to that of Cicero’s more
intimate letters. It is full of colloquial idioms and familiar
language, of the diminutives of affection or of playfulness.
Greek words are rare, especially in the lyrics, and those which
are employed are only such as had come to be current coin.
Archaisms are but sparingly introduced; but for metrical
reasons he has four instances of the inf. pass., in -<i>ier</i>, and several
contracted forms; we find also <i>alis</i> and <i>alid</i>, <i>uni</i> (gen.), and the
antiquated <i>tetuli</i> and <i>recepso</i>. There are traces of the popular
language in the shortened imperatives <i>cavĕ</i> and <i>manĕ</i>, in the
analytic perfect <i>paratam habes</i>, and in the use of <i>unus</i> approaching
that of the indefinite article.
</p><p>58. <i>Horace.</i>—The poets of the Augustan age mark the opening
of a new chapter in the history of the Latin language. The
influence of Horace was less than that of his friend and contemporary
Virgil; for Horace worked in a field of his own, and,
although Statius imitated his lyrics, and Persius and Juvenal,
especially the former, his satires, on the whole there are few
traces of any deep marks left by him on the language of later
writers. In his <i>Satires</i> and <i>Epistles</i> the diction is that of the
contemporary <i>urbanitas</i>, differing hardly at all from that of
Cicero in his epistles and dialogues. The occasional archaisms,
such as the syncope in <i>erepsemus</i>, <i>evasse</i>, <i>surrexe</i>, the infinitives
in -ier, and the genitives <i>deum</i>, <i>divum</i>, may be explained as still
conversationally allowable, though ceasing to be current in
literature; and a similar explanation may account for plebeian
terms, <i>e.g.</i> <i>balatro</i>, <i>blatero</i>, <i>giarrio</i>, <i>mutto</i>, <i>vappa</i>, <i>caldus</i>, <i>soldus</i>,
<i>surpite</i>, for the numerous diminutives, and for such pronouns,
adverbs, conjunctions and turns of expression as were common
in prose, but not found, or found but rarely, in elevated poetry.
Greek words are used sparingly, not with the licence which he
censures in Lucilius, and in his hexameters are framed according
to Latin rules. In the <i>Odes</i>, on the other hand, the language is
much more precisely limited. There are practically no archaisms
(<i>spargier</i> in Carm. iv. 11. 8 is a doubtful exception), or plebeian
expressions; Greek inflections are employed, but not with the
licence of Catullus; there are no datives in <i>ĭ</i> or <i>sĭn</i> like <i>Tethyĭ</i>
or <i>Dryasin</i>; Greek constructions are fairly numerous, <i>e.g.</i> the
genitive with verbs like <i>regnare</i>, <i>abstinere</i>, <i>desinere</i>, and with
adjectives, as <i>integer vitae</i>, the so-called Greek accusative, the
dative with verbs of contest, like <i>luctari</i>, <i>decertare</i>, the transitive
use of many intransitive verbs in the past participle, as <i>regnatus</i>,
<i>triumphatus</i>; and finally there is a “prolative” use of the
infinitive after verbs and adjectives, where prose would have
employed other constructions, which, though not limited to
Horace, is more common with him than with other poets.
Compounds are very sparingly employed, and apparently only
when sanctioned by authority. His own innovations in vocabulary
are not numerous. About eighty <span title="hapax legomena"><link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">ἅπαξ λεγόμενα</span></span> have
been noted. Like Virgil, he shows his exquisite skill in the use
of language rather in the selection from already existing stores,
than in the creation of new resources: <i>tantum series iuncturaque</i>
<i>pollet</i>. But both his diction and his syntax left much less marked
traces upon succeeding writers than did those of either Virgil
or Ovid.
</p><p>59. <i>Virgil.</i>—In Virgil the Latin language reached its full
maturity. What Cicero was to the period, Virgil was to the
hexameter; indeed the changes that he wrought were still
more marked, inasmuch as the language of verse admits of
greater subtlety and finish than even the most artistic prose.
For the straightforward idiomatic simplicity of Lucretius and
Catullus he substituted a most exact and felicitous diction, rich
with the suggestion of the most varied sources of inspiration.
Sometimes it is a phrase of Homer’s “conveyed” literally with
happy boldness, sometimes it is a line of Ennius, or again some
artistic Sophoclean combination. Virgil was equally familiar
with the great Greek models of style and with the earlier Latin
poets. This learning, guided by an unerring sense of fitness and
harmony, enabled him to give to his diction a music which recalls
at once the fullest tones of the Greek lyre and the lofty strains
of the most genuinely national song. His love of antiquarianism
in language has often been noticed, but it never passes into
pedantry. His vocabulary and constructions are often such as
would have conveyed to his contemporaries a grateful flavour of
the past, but they would never have been unintelligible. Forms
like <i>iusso</i>, <i>olle</i> or <i>admittier</i> can have delayed no one.
</p><p>In the details of syntax it is difficult to notice any peculiarly
Virgilian points, for the reason that his language, like that of
Cicero, became the canon, departures from which were accounted
irregularities. But we may notice as favourite constructions a
free use of oblique cases in the place of the more definite construction
with prepositions usual in prose, <i>e.g.</i> <i>it clamor caelo</i>,
<i>flet noctem</i>, <i>rivis currentia vina</i>, <i>bacchatam iugis Naxon</i>, and many
similar phrases; the employment of some substantives as
adjectives, like <i>venator canis</i>, and vice versa, as <i>plurimus volitans</i>;
a proleptic use of adjectives, as <i>tristia torquebit</i>; idioms involving
<i>ille</i>, <i>atque</i>, <i>deinde</i>, <i>haud</i>, <i>quin</i>, <i>vix</i>, and the frequent occurrence of
passive verbs in their earlier reflexive sense, as <i>induor</i>, <i>velor</i>, <i>pascor</i>.

Livy we find Latin prose in rich maturity. To a training in the
rhetorical schools, and perhaps professional experience as a
teacher of rhetoric, he added a thorough familiarity with contemporary
poetry and with the Greek language; and these
attainments have all deeply coloured his language. It is probable
that the variety of style naturally suggested by the wide range
of his subject matter was increased by a half-unconscious
adoption of the phrases and constructions of the different
authorities whom he followed in different parts of his work;
and the industry of German critics has gone far to demonstrate
a conclusion likely enough in itself. Hence perhaps comes the
fairly long list of archaisms, especially in formulae (cf. Kühnast,
<i>Liv. Synt.</i> pp. 14-18). These are, however, purely isolated
phenomena, which do not affect the general tone. It is different
with the poetical constructions and Graecisms, which appear on
every page. Of the latter we find numerous instances in the use
of the cases, <i>e.g.</i> in genitives like <i>via praedae omissae</i>, <i>oppidum</i>
<i>Antiochiae</i>, <i>aequum campi</i>; in datives like <i>quibusdam volentibus</i>
<i>erat</i>; in accusatives like <i>iurare calumniam</i>, <i>certare multam</i>; an
especially frequent use of transitive verbs absolutely; and the
constant omission of the reflexive pronoun as the subject of an
infinitive in reported speech. To the same source must be
assigned the very frequent pregnant construction with prepositions,
an attraction of relatives, and the great extension of the
employment of relative adverbs of place instead of relative
pronouns, <i>e.g.</i> <i>quo</i> = <i>in quem</i>. Among his poetical characteristics
we may place the extensive list of words which are found for the
first time in his works and in those of Virgil or Ovid, and perhaps
his common use of concrete words for collective, <i>e.g.</i> <i>eques</i> for
<i>equitatus</i>, of abstract terms such as <i>remigium</i>, <i>servitia</i>, <i>robora</i>,
and of frequentative verbs, to say nothing of poetical phrases like
<i>haec ubi dicta dedit, adversum montium</i>, &amp;c. Indications of the
extended use of the subjunctive, which he shares with contemporary
writers, especially poets, are found in the construction
of <i>ante quam</i>, <i>post quam</i> with this mood, even when there is no
underlying notion of anticipation, of <i>donec</i>, and of <i>cum</i> meaning
“whenever.” On the other hand, <i>forsitan</i> and <i>quamvis</i>, as in the
poets, are used with the indicative in forgetfulness of their
original force. Among his individual peculiarities may be
noticed the large number of verbal nouns in -<i>tus</i> (for which
Cicero prefers forms in -<i>tio</i>) and in -<i>tor</i>, and the extensive use
of the past passive participle to replace an abstract substantive,
<i>e.g.</i> <i>ex dictatorio imperio concusso</i>. In the arrangement of words
Livy is much more free than any previous prose writer, aiming,
like the poets, at the most effective order. His periods are constructed
with less regularity than those of Cicero, but they gain
at least as much in variety and energy as they lose in uniformity
of rhythm and artistic finish. His style cannot be more fitly
described than in the language of Quintilian, who speaks of his
<i>mira iucunditas</i> and <i>lactea ubertas</i>.
</p><p>61. <i>Propertius.</i>—The language of Propertius is too distinctly
his own to call for detailed examination here. It cannot be
taken as a specimen of the great current of the Latin language;
it is rather a tributary springing from a source apart, tinging
to some slight extent the stream into which it pours itself, but
soon ceasing to affect it in any perceptible fashion. “His
obscurity, his indirectness and his incoherence” (to adopt the
words of J. P. Postgate) were too much out of harmony with
the Latin taste for him to be regarded as in any sense representative;
sometimes he seems to be hardly writing Latin at all.
Partly from his own strikingly independent genius, partly from
his profound and not always judicious study of the Alexandrian
writers, his poems abound in phrases and constructions which
are without a parallel in Latin poetry. His archaisms and
Graecisms, both in diction and in syntax, are very numerous;
but frequently there is a freedom in the use of cases and prepositions
which can only be due to bold and independent innovations.
His style well deserves a careful study for its own sake
(cf. J. P. Postgate’s <i>Introduction</i>, pp. lvii.-cxxv.); but it is of
comparatively little significance in the history of the language.
</p><p>62. <i>Ovid.</i>—The brief and few poems of Tibullus supply only
what is given much more fully in the works of Ovid. In these
we have the language recognized as that best fitted for poetry
by the fashionable circles in the later years of Augustus. The
style of Ovid bears many traces of the imitation of Virgil, Horace
and Propertius, but it is not less deeply affected by the rhetoric
of the schools. His never-failing fertility of fancy and command
of diction often lead him into a diffuseness which mars the effect
of his best works; according to Quintilian it was only in his
(lost) tragedy of <i>Medea</i> that he showed what real excellence he
might have reached if he had chosen to control his natural
powers. His influence on later poets was largely for evil; if he
taught them smoothness of versification and polish of language,
he also co-operated powerfully with the practice of recitation to
lead them to aim at rhetorical point and striking turns of expression,
instead of a firm grasp of a subject as a whole, and due
subordination of the several parts to the general impression.
Ovid’s own influence on language was not great; he took the
diction of poetry as he found it, formed by the labours of his
predecessors; the conflict between the archaistic and the
Graecizing schools was already settled in favour of the latter;
and all that he did was to accept the generally accepted models
as supplying the material in moulding which his luxuriant fancy
could have free play. He has no deviations from classical
syntax but those which were coming into fashion in his time
(<i>e.g.</i> <i>forsitan</i> and <i>quamvis</i> with the indic., the dative of the agent
with passive verbs, the ablative for the accusative of time, the
infinitive after adjectives like <i>certus</i>, <i>aptus</i>, &amp;c.), and but few
peculiarities in his vocabulary. It is only in the letters from the
Pontus that laxities of construction are detected, which show
that the purity of his Latin was impaired by his residence away
from Rome, and perhaps by increasing carelessness of composition.
</p><p>63. <i>The Latin of Daily Life.</i>—While the leading writers of the
Ciceronian and Augustan eras enable us to trace the gradual
development of the Latin language to its utmost finish as an
instrument of literary expression, there are some less important
authors who supply valuable evidence of the character of the
<i>sermo plebeius</i>. Among them may be placed the authors of the
<i>Bellum Africanum</i> and the <i>Bellum Hispaniense</i> appended to
Caesar’s Commentaries. These are not only far inferior to the
exquisite <i>urbanitas</i> of Caesar’s own writings; they are much
rougher in style even than the less polished <i>Bellum Alexandrinum</i>
and <i>De Bello Gallico Liber VIII.</i>, which are now with justice
ascribed to Hirtius. There is sufficient difference between the
two to justify us in assuming two different authors; but both
freely employ words and constructions which are at once antiquated
and vulgar. The writer of the <i>Bellum Alexandrinum</i>
uses a larger number of diminutives within his short treatise
than Caesar in nearly ten times the space; <i>postquam</i> and <i>ubi</i>
are used with the pluperfect subjunctive; there are numerous
forms unknown to the best Latin, like <i>tristimonia</i>, <i>exporrigere</i>,
<i>cruciabiliter</i> and <i>convulnero</i>; <i>potior</i> is followed by the accusative,
a simple relative by the subjunctive. There is also a very
common use of the pluperfect for the imperfect, which seems a
mark of this <i>plebeius sermo</i> (Nipperdey, <i>Quaest. Caes.</i> pp. 13-30).
</p>
<div style="font-size: 92%; line-height: 1.3em">
<p>Another example of what we may call the Latin of business life is
supplied by Vitruvius. Besides the obscurity of many of his technical
expressions, there is a roughness and looseness in his language, far
removed from a literary style; he shares the incorrect use of the
pluperfect, and uses plebeian forms like <i>calefaciuntur</i>, <i>faciliter</i>,
<i>expertiones</i> and such careless phrases as <i>rogavit Archimedem uti in</i>
<i>se sumeret sibi de eo cogitationem</i>. At a somewhat later stage we
have, not merely plebeian, but also provincial Latin represented in
the Satyricon of Petronius. The narrative and the poems which are
introduced into it are written in a style distinguished only by the
ordinary peculiarities of silver Latinity; but in the numerous
conversations the distinctions of language appropriate to the various
speakers are accurately preserved; and we have in the talk of the
slaves and provincials a perfect storehouse of words and constructions
of the greatest linguistic value. Among the unclassical forms
and constructions may be noticed masculines like <i>fatus</i>, <i>vinus</i>,
<i>balneus</i>, <i>fericulus</i> and <i>lactem</i> (for <i>lac</i>), <i>striga</i> for <i>strix</i>, <i>gaudimonium</i>
and <i>tristimonium</i>, <i>sanguen</i>, <i>manducare</i>, <i>nutricare</i>, <i>molestare</i>, <i>nesapius</i>
(<i>sapius</i> = Fr. <i>sage</i>), <i>rostrum</i> (= <i>os</i>), <i>ipsimus</i> (= master), <i>scordalias</i>,
<i>baro</i>, and numerous diminutives like <i>camella</i>, <i>audaculus</i>, <i>potiuncula</i>,&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="256" data-page-number="256" data-page-name="Page:EB1911 - Volume 16.djvu/276" data-page-index="276" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_16.djvu/276"><span id="pageindex_276" class="pagenum-inner ws-noexport">&#8203;</span></span></span><i>savunculum</i>, <i>offla</i>, <i>peduclus</i>, <i>corcillum</i>, with constructions such as
<i>maledicere</i> and <i>persuadere</i> with the accusative, and <i>adiutare</i> with the
dative, and the deponent forms <i>pudeatur</i> and <i>ridetur</i>. Of especial
interest for the Romance languages are <i>astrum</i> (<i>désastre</i>), <i>berbex</i>
(<i>brébis</i>), <i>botellus</i> (<i>boyau</i>), <i>improperare</i>, <i>muttus</i>, <i>naufragare</i>.
</p><p>Suetonius (<i>Aug.</i> <i>c.</i> 87) gives an interesting selection of plebeian
words employed in conversation by Augustus, who for the rest was
something of a purist in his written utterances: <i>ponit assidue et pro</i>
<i>stulto baceolum, et pro pullo pulleiaceum, et pro cerrito vacerrosum, et</i>
<i>vapide se habere pro male, et betizare pro languere, quod vulgo lachanizare</i>
<i>dicitur</i>.
</p><p>The inscriptions, especially those of Pompeii, supply abundant
evidence of the corruptions both of forms and of pronunciation
common among the vulgar. It is not easy always to determine
whether a mutilated form is evidence of a letter omitted in pronunciation,
or only in writing; but it is clear that the ordinary man
habitually dropped final <i>m</i>, <i>s</i>, and <i>t</i>, omitted <i>n</i> before <i>s</i>, and pronounced
<i>ĭ</i> like <i>ĕ</i>. There are already signs of the decay of <i>ae</i> to <i>e</i>,
which later on became almost universal. The additions to our
vocabulary are slight and unimportant (cf. <i>Corpus Inscr.</i> Lat. iv.,
with Zangemeister’s <i>Indices</i>).

<p>64. To turn to the language of literature. In the dark days
of Tiberius and the two succeeding emperors a paralysis seemed
to have come upon prose and poetry alike. With the one exception
of oratory, literature had long been the utterance of a
narrow circle, not the expression of the energies of national life;
and now, while all free speech in the popular assemblies was
silenced, the nobles were living under a suspicious despotism,
which, whatever the advantage which it brought to the poorer
classes and to the provincials, was to them a reign of terror.
It is no wonder that the fifty years after the accession of Tiberius
are a blank as regards all higher literature. Velleius Paterculus,
Valerius Maximus, Celsus and Phaedrus give specimens of the
Latin of the time, but the style of no one of these, classical for
the most part in vocabulary, but occasionally approaching the
later usages in syntax, calls for special analysis. The elder
Seneca in his collection of <i>suasoriae</i> and <i>controversiae</i> supplies
examples of the barren quibblings by which the young Romans
were trained in the rhetorical schools. A course of instruction,
which may have been of service when its end was efficiency in
active public life, though even then not without its serious drawbacks,
as is shown by Cicero in his treatise <i>De Oratore</i>, became
seriously injurious when its object was merely idle display.
Prose came to be overloaded with ornament, and borrowed too
often the language, though not the genius, of poetry; while
poetry in its turn, partly owing to the fashion of recitation,
became a string of rhetorical points.
</p><p>65. <i>Seneca, Persius and Lucan.</i>—In the writers of Nero’s age
there are already plain indications of the evil effects of the
rhetorical schools upon language as well as literature. The
leading man of letters was undoubtedly Seneca the younger,
“the Ovid of prose”; and his style set the model which it
became the fashion to imitate. But it could not commend itself
to the judgment of sound critics like Quintilian, who held firmly
to the great masters of an earlier time. He admits its brilliance,
and the fertility of its pointed reflections, but charges the author
justly with want of self-restraint, jerkiness, frequent repetitions
and tawdry tricks of rhetoric. Seneca was the worst of models,
and pleased by his very faults. In his tragedies the rhetorical
elaboration of the style only serves to bring into prominence
the frigidity and frequent bad taste of the matter. But his
diction is on the whole fairly classical; he is, in the words of
Muretus, <i>vetusti sermonis diligentior quam quidam inepte fastidiosi</i>
<i>suspicantur</i>. In Persius there is a constant straining after
rhetorical effect, which fills his verses with harsh and obscure
expressions. The careful choice of diction by which his master
Horace makes every word tell is exaggerated into an endeavour
to gain force and freshness by the most contorted phrases. The
sin of allusiveness is fostered by the fashion of the day for
epigram, till his lines are barely intelligible after repeated reading.
Conington happily suggested that this style was assumed
only for satiric purposes, and pointed out that when not writing
satire Persius was as simple and unaffected as Horace himself.
This view, while it relieves Persius of much of the censure
which has been directed against his want of judgment, makes
him all the more typical a representative of this stage of silver
Latinity. In his contemporary Lucan we have another example
of the faults of a style especially attractive to the young, handled
by a youth of brilliant but ill-disciplined powers. The <i>Pharsalia</i>
abounds in spirited rhetoric, in striking epigram, in high sounding
declamation; but there are no flights of sustained imagination,
no ripe wisdom, no self-control in avoiding the exaggerated or
the repulsive, no mature philosophy of life or human destiny.
Of all the Latin poets he is the least Virgilian. It has been said
of him that he corrupted the style of poetry, not less than Seneca
that of prose.
</p><p>66. <i>Pliny</i>, <i>Quintilian</i>, <i>Frontinus</i>.—In the elder Pliny the same
tendencies are seen occasionally breaking out in the midst of the
prosaic and inartistic form in which he gives out the stores of his
cumbrous erudition. Wherever he attempts a loftier tone than
that of the mere compiler, he falls into the tricks of Seneca.
The nature of his encyclopaedic subject matter naturally makes
his vocabulary very extensive; but in syntax and general tone
of language he does not differ materially from contemporary
writers. Quintilian is of interest especially for the sound judgment
which led him to a true appreciation of the writers of
Rome’s golden age. He set himself strenuously to resist the
tawdry rhetoric fashionable in his own time, and to hold up
before his pupils purer and loftier models. His own criticisms
are marked by excellent taste, and often by great happiness of
expression, which is pointed without being unduly epigrammatic.
But his own style did not escape, as indeed it hardly could, the
influences of his time; and in many small points his language
falls short of classical purity. There is more approach to the
simplicity of the best models in Frontinus, who furnishes a
striking proof that it was rather the corruption of literary taste
than any serious change in the language of ordinary cultivated
men to which the prevalent style was due. Writing on practical
matters—the art of war and the water-supply of Rome—he goes
straight to the point without rhetorical flourishes; and the
ornaments of style which he occasionally introduces serve to
embellish but not to distort his thought.
</p><p>67. <i>The Flavian Age.</i>—The epic poets of the Flavian age
present a striking contrast to the writers of the Claudian period.
As a strained originality was the cardinal fault of the one school,
so a tame and slavish following of authority is the mark of
the other. The general <i>correctness</i> of this period may perhaps
be ascribed (with Merivale) partly to the political conditions,
partly to the establishment of professional schools. Teachers
like Quintilian must have done much to repress extravagance
of thought and language; but they could not kindle the spark
of genius. Valerius Flaccus, Silius Italicus and Papinius Statius
are all correct in diction and in rhythm, and abound in learning;
but their inspiration is drawn from books and not from nature or
the heart; details are elaborated to the injury of the impression
of the whole; every line is laboured, and overcharged with
epigrammatic rhetoric. Statius shows by far the greatest
natural ability and freshness; but he attempts to fill a broad
canvas with drawing and colouring suited only to a miniature.
Juvenal exemplifies the tendencies of the language of his time,
as moulded by a singularly powerful mind. A careful study of
the earlier poets, especially Virgil and Lucan, has kept his
language up to a high standard of purity. His style is eminently
rhetorical; but it is rhetoric of real power. The concise brevity
by which it is marked seems to have been the result of a deliberate
attempt to mould his natural diffuseness into the form recognized
as most appropriate for satire. In his verses we notice a few
metrical peculiarities which represent the pronunciation of his
age, especially the shortening of the final -<i>o</i> in verbs, but as a
rule they conform to the Virgilian standard. In Martial the
tendency of this period to witty epigram finds its most perfect
embodiment, combined with finished versification.
</p><p>68. <i>Pliny the Younger and Tacitus.</i>—The typical prose-writers
of this time are Pliny the younger and Tacitus. Some features
of the style of Tacitus are peculiar to himself; but on the whole
the following statement represents the tendencies shared in
greater or less degree by all the writers of this period. The
gains lie mainly in the direction of a more varied and occasionally&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="257" data-page-number="257" data-page-name="Page:EB1911 - Volume 16.djvu/277" data-page-index="277" data-page-quality="4" title="Page:EB1911_-_Volume_16.djvu/277"><span id="pageindex_277" class="pagenum-inner ws-noexport">&#8203;</span></span></span>more effective syntax; its most striking defect is a lack of
harmony in the periods, of arrangements in words, of variety
in particles arising from the loose connexion of sentences. The
vocabulary is extended, but there are losses as well as gains.
Quintilian’s remarks are fully borne out by the evidence of
extant authorities: on the one hand, <i>quid quod nihil iam proprium</i>
<i>placet</i>, <i>dum parum creditur disertum</i>, <i>quod et alius dixisset</i> (viii.
<i>prooem.</i> 24); <i>a corruptissimo quoque poetarum figuras seu translationes</i>
<i>mutuamur</i>; <i>tum demum ingeniosi scilicet</i>, <i>si ad intelligendos</i>
<i>nos opus sit ingenio</i> (<i>ib.</i> 25); <i>sordet omne quod natura dictavit</i>
(<i>ib.</i> 26); on the other hand, <i>nunc utique</i>, <i>cum haec exercitatio</i>
<i>procul a veritate seiuncta laboret incredibili verborum fastidio</i>, <i>ac</i>
<i>sibi magnam partem sermonis absciderit</i> (viii. 3, 23), <i>multa cotidie</i>
<i>ab antiquis ficta moriuntur</i> (<i>ib.</i> 6, 32). A writer like Suetonius
therefore did good service in introducing into his writings terms
and phrases borrowed, not from the rhetoricians, but from the
usage of daily life.
</p>
<div style="font-size: 92%; line-height: 1.3em">
<p>69. In the vocabulary of Tacitus there are to be noted:—
</p><p>1. Words borrowed (consciously or unconsciously) from the
classical poets, especially Virgil, occurring for the most part also in
contemporary prose. Of these Dräger gives a list of ninety-five
(<i>Syntax und Stil des Tacitus</i>, p. 96).
</p><p>2. Words occurring only, or for the first time, in Tacitus. These
are for the most part new formations or compounds from stems
already in use, especially verbal substantives in -<i>tor</i> and -<i>sor</i>, -<i>tus</i> and
-<i>sus</i>, -<i>tura</i> and -<i>mentum</i>, with new frequentatives.
</p><p>3. Words used with a meaning (<i>a</i>) not found in earlier prose,
but sometimes borrowed from the poets, <i>e.g.</i> <i>componere</i>, “to bury”;
<i>scriptura</i>, “a writing”; <i>ferratus</i> “armed with a sword”; (<i>b</i>)
peculiar to later writers, <i>e.g.</i> <i>numerosus</i>, “numerous”; <i>famosus</i>,
“famous”; <i>decollare</i>, “to behead”; <i>imputare</i>, “to take credit
for,” &amp;c.; (<i>c</i>) restricted to Tacitus himself, <i>e.g. dispergere</i> = <i>divolgare</i>.
</p><p>Generally speaking, Tacitus likes to use a simple verb instead of
a compound one, after the fashion of the poets, employs a pluperfect
for a perfect, and (like Livy and sometimes Caesar) aims at vividness
and variety by retaining the present and perfect subjunctive in
indirect speech even after historical tenses. Collective words are
followed by a plural far more commonly than in Cicero. The ellipse
of a verb is more frequent. The use of the cases approximates to
that of the poets, and is even more free. The accusative of limitation
is common in Tacitus, though never found in Quintilian. Compound
verbs are frequently followed by the accusative where the dative
might have been expected; and the Virgilian construction of an
accusative with middle and passive verbs is not unusual. The
dative of purpose and the dative with a substantive in place of a
genitive are more common with Tacitus than with any writer.
The ablative of separation is used without a preposition, even with
names of countries and with common nouns; the ablative of place
is employed similarly without a preposition; the ablative of time
has sometimes the force of duration; the instrumental ablative is
employed even of persons. A large extension is given to the use
of the quantitative genitive after neuter adjectives and pronouns,
and even adverbs, and to the genitive with active participles; and
the genitive of relation after adjectives is (probably by a Graecism)
very freely employed. In regard to prepositions, there are special
uses of <i>citra</i>, <i>erga</i>, <i>iuxta</i> and <i>tenus</i> to be noted, and a frequent tendency
to interchange the use of a preposition with that of a simple case in
corresponding clauses. In subordinate sentences <i>quod</i> is used for
“the fact that,” and sometimes approaches the later use of “that”;
the infinitive follows many verbs and adjectives that do not admit
of this construction in classical prose; the accusative and infinitive
are used after negative expressions of doubt, and even in modal
and hypothetical clauses.
</p><p>Like Livy, the writers of this time freely employ the subjunctive
of repeated action with a relative, and extend its use to relative
conjunctions, which he does not. In clauses of comparison and
proportion there is frequently an ellipse of a verb (with <i>nihil aliud</i>
<i>quam</i>, <i>ut</i>, <i>tanquam</i>); <i>tanquam</i>, <i>quasi</i> and <i>velut</i> are used to imply not
comparison but alleged reason; <i>quin</i> and <i>quominus</i> are interchanged
at pleasure. <i>Quamquam</i> and <i>quamvis</i> are commonly
followed by the subjunctive, even when denoting facts. The free
use of the genitive and dative of the gerundive to denote purpose is
common in Tacitus, the former being almost limited to him. Livy’s
practice in the use of participles is extended even beyond the limits
to which he restricts it. It has been calculated that where Caesar
uses five participial clauses, Livy has sixteen, Tacitus twenty-four.
</p><p>In his compressed brevity Tacitus may be said to be individual;
but in the poetical colouring of his diction, in the rhetorical cast of
his sentences, and in his love for picturesqueness and variety he is a
true representative of his time.
</p>
</div>
<p>70. <i>Suetonius.</i>—The language of Suetonius is of interest as
giving a specimen of silver Latinity almost entirely free from
personal idiosyncrasies; his expressions are regular and straightforward,
clear and business-like; and, while in grammar he
does not attain to classical purity, he is comparatively free from
rhetorical affectations.
</p><p>71. <i>The African Latinity.</i>—A new era commences with the
accession of Hadrian (117). As the preceding half century had
been marked by the influence of Spanish Latinity (the Senecas,
Lucan, Martial, Quintilian), so in this the African style was
paramount. This is the period of affected archaisms and
pedantic learning, combined at times with a reckless love of
innovation and experiment, resulting in the creation of a large
number of new formations and in the adoption of much of the
plebeian dialect. Fronto and Apuleius mark a strong reaction
against the culture of the preceding century, and for evil far
more than for good the chain of literary tradition was broken.
The language which had been unduly refined and elaborated
now relapsed into a tasteless and confused patch-work, without
either harmony or brilliance of colouring. In the case of the
former the subject matter is no set-off against the inferiority of
the style. He deliberately attempts to go back to the obsolete
diction of writers like Cato and Ennius. We find compounds
like <i>altipendulus</i>, <i>nudiustertianus</i>, <i>tolutiloquentia</i>, diminutives
such as <i>matercella</i>, <i>anulla</i>, <i>passercula</i>, <i>studiolum</i>, forms like
<i>congarrire</i>, <i>disconcinnus</i>, <i>pedetemptius</i>, <i>desiderantissimus</i> (passive),
<i>conticinium</i>; <i>gaudeo</i>, <i>oboedio</i> and <i>perfungor</i> are used with an
accusative, <i>modestus</i> with a genitive. On the other hand he
actually attempts to revive the form <i>asa</i> for <i>ara</i>. In Apuleius
the archaic element is only one element in the queer mixture
which constitutes his style, and it probably was not intended
to give the tone to the whole. Poetical and prosaic phrases,
Graecisms, solecisms, jingling assonances, quotations and
coinages apparently on the spur of the moment, all appear in
this wonderful medley. There are found such extraordinary
genitives as <i>sitire beatitudinis</i>, <i>cenae pignerarer</i>, <i>incoram omnium</i>,
<i>foras corporis</i>, sometimes heaped one upon another as <i>fluxos</i>
<i>vestium Arsacidas et frugum pauperes Ityraeos et odorum divites</i>
<i>Arabas</i>. Diminutives are coined with reckless freedom, <i>e.g.</i>
<i>diutule</i>, <i>longule</i>, <i>mundule amicta el altiuscule sub ipsas papillas</i>
<i>succinctula</i>. He confesses himself that he is writing in a language
not familiar to him: <i>In urbe Latia advena studiorum Quiritium</i>
<i>indigenam sermonem aerumnabili labore</i>, <i>nullo magistro praeeunte</i>,
<i>aggressus excolui</i>; and the general impression of his style fully
bears out his confession. Melanchthon is hardly too severe when
he says that Apuleius brays like his own ass. The language of
Aulus Gellius is much superior in purity; but still it abounds
in rare and archaic words, <i>e.g.</i> <i>edulcare</i>, <i>recentari</i>, <i>aeruscator</i>,
and in meaningless frequentatives like <i>solitavisse</i>. He has some
admirable remarks on the pedantry of those who delighted in
obsolete expressions (xi. 7) such as <i>apluda</i>, <i>flocus</i> and <i>bovinator</i>;
but his practice falls far short of his theory.
</p><p>72. <i>The Lawyers.</i>—The style of the eminent lawyers of this
period, foremost among whom is Gaius, deserves especial notice
as showing well one of the characteristic excellences of the Latin
language. It is for the most part dry and unadorned, and in
syntax departs occasionally from classical usages, but it is clear,
terse and exact. Technical terms may cause difficulty to the
ordinary reader, but their meaning is always precisely defined;
new compounds are employed whenever the subject requires
them, but the capacities of the language rise to the demands
made upon it; and the conceptions of jurisprudence have never
been more adequately expressed than by the great Romanist
jurists.

The grounds for this pronunciation will be found best stated in
Postgate, <i>How to pronounce Latin</i> (1907), Arnold and Conway, <i>The</i>
<i>Restored Pronunciation of Greek and Latin</i> (4th ed., Cambridge, 1908);
and in the grammars enumerated in § 28 above, especially the preface
to vol. i. of <i>Roby’s Grammar</i>. The chief points about <i>c</i> may be briefly
given as a specimen of the kind of evidence. (1) In some words the
letter following c varies in a manner which makes it impossible to
believe that the pronunciation of the <i>c</i> depended upon this, <i>e.g.</i>
<i>decumus</i> and <i>decimus</i>, <i>dīc</i> from Plaut. <i>dīce</i>; (2) if <i>c</i> was pronounced
before <i>e</i> and <i>i</i> otherwise than before <i>a</i>, <i>o</i> and <i>u</i>, it is hard to see why
<i>k</i> should not have been retained for the latter use; (3) no ancient
writer gives any hint of a varying pronunciation of <i>c</i>; (4) a Greek <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r12033801"/><span lang="grc" dir="ltr" class="wst-lang wst-lang-grc">κ</span>
