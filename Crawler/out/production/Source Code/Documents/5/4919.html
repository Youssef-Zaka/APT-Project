  <h1>BERNE CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF<br />
  LITERARY AND ARTISTIC WORKS (Paris Text 1971)</h1>
  <hr />

  <h2>Article 5</h2>

  <p><a name="5(1)">(1)</a> Authors shall enjoy, in respect of
  works for which they are protected under this Convention, in
  countries of the Union other than the country of origin, the
  rights which their respective laws do now or may hereafter grant
  to their nationals, as well as the rights specially granted by
  this Convention.</p>

  <p><a name="5(2)">(2)</a> The enjoyment and the exercise of these
  rights shall not be subject to any formality; such enjoyment and
  such exercise shall be independent of the existence of protection
  in the country of origin of the work. Consequently, apart from
  the provisions of this Convention, the extent of protection, as
  well as the means of redress afforded to the author to protect
  his rights, shall be governed exclusively by the laws of the
  country where protection is claimed.</p>

  <p><a name="5(3)">(3)</a> Protection in the country of origin is
  governed by domestic law. However, when the author is not a
  national of the country of origin of the work for which he is
  protected under this Convention, he shall enjoy in that country
  the same rights as national authors.</p>

  <p><a name="5(4)">(4)</a> The country of origin shall be
  considered to be</p>

  <ul>
    <li>(a) in the case of works first published in a country of
    the Union, that country; in the case of works published
    simultaneously in several countries of the Union which grant
    different terms of protection, the country whose legislation
    grants the shortest term of protection;</li>

    <li>(b) in the case of works published simultaneously in a
    country outside the Union and in a country of the Union, the
    latter country;</li>

    <li>(c) in the case of unpublished works or of works first
    published in a country outside the Union, without simultaneous
    publication in a country of the Union, the country of the Union
    of which the author is a national, provided that:

      <ul>
        <li>(i) when these are cinematographic works the maker of
        which has his headquarters or his habitual residence in a
        country of the Union, the country of origin shall be that
        country, and</li>

        <li>(ii) when these are works of architecture erected in a
        country of the Union or other artistic works incorporated
        in a building or other structure located in a country of
        the Union, the country of origin shall be that
        country.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
