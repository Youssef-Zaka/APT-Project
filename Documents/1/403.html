We were able to utilise a community driven development approach to build this product in concert and ensure we were delivering the most helpful tool we could.

This is not just for items you own, but any item that you have the permission to edit via impersonation.

These achievements were made possible by building upon scientific research made openly available. There has been a major shift in the way research is shared: it&rsquo;s now more open and more reusable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Figshare, we&rsquo;re celebrating 10 years of making research data and other scholarly outputs openly available, accessible, reusable, and citable in the name of progressing scientific research. It began as a place for our Founder and Stem Cell Biologist, Mark Hahnel, to share his videos of stem cells and other non-traditional research outputs (NTROs) that formed part of his PhD research and get credit for them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a webinar celebrating our decade-long existence, Mark highlighted the achievements of the last ten years including the rise of Open Access and preprints and better access to literature and data.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;A decade ago, you couldn&rsquo;t publish 5MB videos in the supporting information section of publications,&rdquo; said Mark. Figshare now hosts nearly 6 million items including datasets, videos, software, presentations, papers, and more and is the repository solution of almost 200 universities, publishers, funders, government agencies, and pharmaceutical organizations all over the world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2011, the vision for Figshare was one of reducing the duplication of research carried out by the scientific community and publishing previously unpublished research. Figshare Alpha was a neon corner of the internet with a mission for advancing scientific research by sharing all research &mdash; nul results and all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We went through a few iterations of the platform over the next couple of years with various UI and UX designs but the message was always the same: get credit for your research, even if the data are negative.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QsbteDb.png[/img]\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"485\" /><br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2013, V1 launched as a freemium model with functionality to cite items published on Figshare &mdash; meaning they had a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) &mdash; plus users could use Figshare as private spaces to work on projects and publish them directly in Figshare when appropriate. It also included a GitHub integration making it possible for software to be assigned a DOI for citing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the next eight years, we developed a whole host of functionality based entirely on community feedback, funder/government/legal requirements, legal and regulatory requirements, and more to deliver repository infrastructure to organizations. Some of the key, groundbreaking features include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HR feed/SSO integrations and user management</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an </span><a href=\"https://www.altmetric.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Altmetric</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> integration</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DOI versioning</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a robust, fully-documented </span><a href=\"https://docs.figshare.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">API</span></a></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">advanced search capabilities</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">review module</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">advanced custom metadata</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a </span><a href=\"https://www.dimensions.ai/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dimensions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> integration to allow for funding links</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a </span><a href=\"https://www.readcube.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ReadCube</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> integration to view Open Access PDFs straight from the references section</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/02.01.02_60/en_301549v020102p.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EN 301 549</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WCAG 2.1 AA</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and </span><a href=\"https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Section 508</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> accessibility compliance</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">restricted publishing and requesting access</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sherpa Romeo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> integration for checking compliance with publisher policies on Open Access archiving</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s also worth celebrating the community that has flourished over the last decade. There have been countless Figshare Fests (our community user days), webinars, case studies, Slack conversations, and video calls among the community of organizations using Figshare. These have been for the sole purpose of sharing knowledge, best practices, and asking questions of each other to make each users&rsquo; experience better and more progressive for the sharing of scientific knowledge.</span><br /><br /><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GWz2hcg.png[/img]\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"487\" /><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ErrantScience/status/1229777621296320514,\">https://twitter.com/ErrantScience/status/1229777621296320514,</a><a href=\"https://errantscience.com/\"> https://errantscience.com/</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/figshare\">a 2014 interview with <em>Wired</em></a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Mark was asked where he saw the company and academia in ten years&rsquo; time. &ldquo;For us the Shangri-La is a world where a group of researchers generate new information based on new hypotheses, make it available on Figshare and then others pull together the combined world's knowledge to look for new patterns and discoveries that the original authors had not thought to look for. These data scientists will need tools, which we have already made available on our open API. I'd love to see more of these tools helping more people make more discoveries, more often.&rdquo; This is already happening &mdash; with the tracking of citations and Altmetrics on item pages, users can see who is mentioning and reusing their data and the progression that&rsquo;s had on scientific advancement. Take </span><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4654045\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this use case</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for example, of a University of Sheffield researcher who made his data available on Figshare and has since developed collaborations and new lines of enquiry into adjacent areas of research.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there&rsquo;s still a long way to go in some areas. &ldquo;Slightly frustrating for me is that while there has been innovation in the space, the majority of Open Access is Gold Open Access and not Green Open Access. This is just one area, we need to be focussing our attention, to make things more equitable,&rdquo; said Mark. &ldquo;I also thought we&rsquo;d solve the problem of sharing and getting credit for negative data. I don&rsquo;t think that problem has moved as fast as I&rsquo;d like; there&rsquo;s still a lot of valid negative data that doesn&rsquo;t get published.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we may have been quite inwardly focussed in the early days of Figshare, the Shangri-la vision seems more in-reach, albeit through a plethora of tools and repositories that have since emerged. Deepmind&rsquo;s Alphafold has recently demonstrated the power of well-curated, homogenous open data. When thinking of research data, future consumers will not just be human researchers &mdash; we also need to feed the machines. This means that computers will need to interpret content with little or no human intervention. For this to be possible, the outputs need to be in machine readable formats and the metadata needs to be sufficient to describe exactly what the data are and how the data was generated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We at Figshare will continue to support organizations in making life easy for their researchers to create, share, and store well-curated, homogenous open data.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s hope for even further progress in the next 10 years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">_______________________________________________________________</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We held a webinar recently celebrating 10 Years of Figshare, where our Founder and CEO, Mark Hahnel, looked back at the evolution of research management and our Product Director, Chris Blumzon, reflected on the features and functionality we&rsquo;ve developed in the last decade.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8jNW3j9.png[/img]\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"280\" /></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/recording/8215530413943661832\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch the webinar&nbsp;</span></a></p>", "categories": [], "isPublished": true, "isDraft": false, "isFeatured": true, "publicUrl": "https://figshare.com/blog/Ten_Years_of_Figshare_What_We_ve_Achieved_And_What_s_Next/653", "publishedDate": "2022-04-06T08:00:08Z"}, {"id": 650, "title": "Figshare awarded NIH Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative grant to enhance functionality for research community", "author": "Megan Hardeman", "excerpt": "<p>Figshare is pleased to participate in a new NIH initiative, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://datascience.nih.gov/news/nih-office-of-data-science-strategy-announces-new-initiative-to-improve-data-access\">Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative (GREI)</a>.

There&rsquo;s no time to lose.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since 2016, we have monitored levels of data sharing and usage, and in this, our sixth survey, we asked about motivations as well as perceived discoverability and credibility of data that is shared openly.&nbsp; As 65% of respondents have never received credit or acknowledgement for sharing data, Barbour is correct that the incentives are not there to encourage sharing, and in order to improve this, the system needs to change.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Over 4,200 researchers from around the world completed the survey, reporting increasing concern about misuse of data as well as a lack of credit and acknowledgement for those who do openly share their data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of particular interest to </span><strong>universities</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may be the findings that 76% of survey respondents believe they currently get too little credit for sharing data while 30% said they would rely upon their institutional library for help making their research data openly available.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For </span><strong>publishers: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">47% of survey respondents said they would be motivated to share their data if there was a journal or publisher requirement to do so. 53% of survey respondents obtained research data collected by other research groups from within a published research article&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, </span><strong>funders</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may take note of the 52% of survey respondents who said funders should make the sharing of research data part of their requirements for awarding grants. Additionally, 48% of survey respondents said that funding should be withheld (or a penalty incurred) if researchers do not share their data when the funder has mandated that they do so at the grant application stage.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Government agencies</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may be interested to learn that 73% of survey respondents strongly or somewhat support the idea of a national mandate for making research data openly available. 33% would like more guidance on how to comply with government policies on making research data openly available.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other key findings are that:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">53% of survey respondents said it was extremely important that data are available from a publicly available repository</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">55% of survey respondents felt they needed support in regard to copyright and licenses when making research data openly available</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About a third of respondents indicated that they have reused their own or someone else&rsquo;s openly accessible data more during the pandemic than before</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our respondents will likely be researchers who are interested in the topic so we thought we would see support for mandates but we were surprised that more than half of people responding to the survey felt they needed support around copyright and licenses when making data available.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of great concern is the lack of credit and acknowledgement for sharing data. The traditional system rewards publishing of novel findings in journals, rather than the sharing of confirmatory or negative results or underlying data and other materials related to the research. This needs to change. The pandemic has shown that sharing of data openly increases progress and benefits society. This need not be limited to public health emergencies; there are many areas of research that bring direct benefits to society, not least that which addresses the current climate emergency. Opening up research is not the whole answer but it brings with it trust in science and this will be crucial as we move through the next decade and beyond.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Respondents&rsquo; motivations for data sharing are tied to traditional measurements of impact and credit, with 19% of respondents motivated by citation of their research papers, 14% by co-authorship on papers, 11% by increased impact and visibility of research, and 11% on public benefit. There are calls for credit systems to be put in place such as the </span><a href=\"https://www.aamc.org/what-we-do/mission-areas/medical-research/data-sharing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Credit for Data Sharing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> initiative, though nothing is widely implemented at present.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We first started asking about the </span><a href=\"https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FAIR</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> principles &mdash; ensuring data is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable &mdash; in 2018 and this is the fifth anniversary of the FAIR principles. Awareness and compliance is higher than in previous years and 28% of respondents say that they are familiar with the principles, and more than half (54%) thought their data was very much or somewhat compliant with FAIR data principles. These findings indicate that concern over sharing data could lessen in the long run if data are as accessible and reusable as possible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elsewhere in the report are essays on data curation for enhancing data and metadata quality and tips for engaging researchers in open data sharing practices.

To be as transparent as possible, nearly all of the DPC cost goes towards covering our costs to host this data securely and redundantly in the cloud. Many funders allow data sharing costs to be included in grant budgets, so you may be able to use grants funds to pay for Figshare+ and can include it in </span><a href=\"https://help.figshare.com/article/how-to-write-a-data-management-plan-dmp-and-include-figshare-in-your-data-sharing-plans\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">data management and sharing plans</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in funding proposals.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because we want researchers to get the most out of their open data, Figshare+ also offers additional license options and metadata compared to figshare.com.

In a Figshare portal or Figshare.com, you can do this straight from &ldquo;Edit Profile&rdquo; or from the Applications page. Click &ldquo;Connect&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll be sent off to ORCID to verify your account and then we can get started. You&rsquo;ll then be presented with 3 options, all off by default. &nbsp; <br /><br /><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GnBL4EA.png[/img]\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"618\" /><br /><br />Going through them one by one:<br /><br /><strong>Push data to my ORCID</strong><br /><br />This option creates a record in your ORCID account of any items that you publish on Figshare. It&rsquo;s good to note that this will create a record using the <strong>base DOI only</strong>, versioned DOIs are omitted. The base DOI will always point to the latest version of your item. This long-requested functionality avoids the issue of significant duplicate entries within your ORCID account. <br /><br />An important note, if you have a synchronisation set up from a DOI provider like Datacite and you enable this option, there is a chance you&rsquo;ll get duplicate records in your ORCID account.<br /><br />This feature will only kick in for items created&nbsp;<strong>after</strong> the integration has been performed. Any existing items in your figshare account will not be pushed using this method. If you need to get historic items into your ORCID account and they have not been captured by the existing Datacite integration, this will need to be done manually. <br /><br /><strong>Pull data from my ORCID to my Figshare account </strong><br /><br />This one is all about your figshare profile and your profile only. Nothing imported here will interact with your My Data area (that&rsquo;s where option 3 comes in).<br /><br />This will import everything in your ORCID works section to the publications area of your figshare profile. Unlike the previous setting, this will import everything&nbsp;<strong>before</strong> the integration was performed as well as anything created ongoing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/si4QWKZ.png[/img]\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"445\" /></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How publications look on a Figshare profile page.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Create draft records from my ORCID data </strong><br /><br />This option is pretty cool even if I say so myself. It's especially useful for uploading open access versions of published works.<br /><br /><strong>After</strong> the integration has occurred, any new records created within the works section of your ORCID account will automatically create a new draft metadata record within your My Data area. We&rsquo;ll pull in as much available metadata as we can, as well as creating the metadata record with the DOI of the original object. Combining this with our new <a href=\"../blog/Sherpa_Romeo_integration_for_Figshare_for_Institutions/636\">Sherpa Romeo integration</a> makes for a very powerful workflow that makes the uploading of appropriate repository versions as slick as can be.<br /><br />Once a new draft item has been created from this integration, you&rsquo;ll get two kinds of notifications: an email to your account email address and a notification within the platform (coming October 2021). You can then choose to add a file for this record, such as an open access version of a publication, and any additional metadata or delete the draft record if it&rsquo;s not needed. <br /><br /><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/uehT6e8.png[/img]\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"286\" /><br /><br /><strong>Won&rsquo;t things get stuck in a loop?</strong></p>\n<p>Maybe you are reading this and thinking &ldquo;Hey! If I import something and it maintains the existing DOI and is then synched back to my ORCID works, won&rsquo;t that then be imported again and create an infinite loop?&rdquo;<br /><br />First of all, great question. Would you like a job at Figshare? Secondly, no, don&rsquo;t worry, due to some behind the scenes magic, these items won&rsquo;t be reimported. <br /><br /><strong>Will things continually create metadata records if I delete them as I don&rsquo;t want to make a repository version for that work?</strong><br /><br />No, things will only be imported once. If you delete them, it won&rsquo;t happen again. <br /><br /><strong>Are there any other implications of connecting my ORCID?</strong><br /><br />Nothing new, but it seems a good time to reiterate the current benefits of having an ORCID and connecting it to your Figshare account:<br /><br />- Your ORCID is part of the item&rsquo;s metadata <br />- Your ORCID is sent along with additional metadata when minting a DOI to a supporting partner such as DataCite<br />- You are searchable by your ORCID within Figshare<br />- Disambiguates your outputs to help with the I (interoperability) in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data\">F.A.I.R.</a><br />- Your ORCID is displayed on your <a href=\"https://help.figshare.com/article/maximise-your-research-profile\">Figshare Author</a> profile page<br /><br /><strong>Do I have to enable all three options? What if I don&rsquo;t enable any?</strong><br /><br />You don&rsquo;t have to enable any of the options. You&rsquo;ll still get all the great benefits listed above if you enable none of them. You can choose to enable any combination of the three, they all will work independently of each other. <br /><br /><strong>If I am using my institution&rsquo;s figshare and it doesn&rsquo;t allow the creation of items with a custom DOI, can I still create metadata records?</strong><br /><br />You can, but these will be created without the original published DOI. They will be published with a new DOI / handle based on your institution&rsquo;s policies. If you are unsure, speak to your institutional administrator about this. <br /><br /><strong>What if I&rsquo;ve already connected my ORCID to my Figshare account?</strong><br /><br />All of the benefits you currently enjoy under &ldquo;Are there any other implications of connecting my ORCID?&rdquo; outlined above that you get now will still continue to work without you doing anything. For any of the new functionality to work, we&rsquo;ll need new permissions from you. This means reauthorizing the ORCID application and away you go. <br /><br /><strong>How frequently are updates sent to ORCID from Figshare and vice versa?</strong><br /><br />With the power of webhooks, updates happen really quickly in a matter of minutes.</p>\n<p>If you have questions or want to discuss this further with a member of our team, please contact <a href=\"mailto:info@figshare.com\">info@figshare.com</a>.</p>", "categories": [], "isPublished": true, "isDraft": false, "isFeatured": true, "publicUrl": "https://figshare.com/blog/Something_old_something_new_Figshare_s_new_ORCID_integration_is_here/639", "publishedDate": "2021-08-31T14:42:54Z"}, {"id": 636, "title": "Sherpa Romeo integration for Figshare for Institutions", "author": "Alan Hyndman", "excerpt": "<p>We&rsquo;re really pleased to announce a Sherpa Romeo integration will be available to all of our Figshare for Institutions users as of September 1st, 2021.</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/H1SP51X.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"153\" /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or indeed, Figshare.

This works for all repositories powered by Figshare and is new in the repository space.

They are the output of the research, and as such have been well described in the metadata.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The past 12 months have been unique in the scholarly publishing landscape, in that there was so much focus on one topic, COVID-19. As expected, this new rapid publishing drive and a large audience of interested parties has led to large citation counts. E.g.:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;COVID-19 severity correlates with airway epithelium-immune cell interactions identified by single-cell analysis&rdquo; </span><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12436517.v2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12436517.v2</span></a></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So are there any datasets that are published to support a publication and then re-used by other research groups?</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we take 2 datasets with a relatively high number of citations, that reference a paper in their metadata and compare them, we can see a key difference. The datasets we are considering are:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Green algal transcriptomes for phylogenetics and comparative genomics<br /></span><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1604778.v1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1604778.v1</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EEG correlates of social interaction at distance<br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1466876.v8\">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1466876.v8</a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3txSMm6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"616\" height=\"347\" /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As can be seen in the above table, whilst there are no huge differences in the metrics that are listed on the landing page, using citation counts as a proxy for re-use highlight that one dataset has largely been re-used by the same authors as the dataset. The other is largely re-used by a distinct set of authors. Of note, the only re-use by non authors for the dataset titled &lsquo;EEG correlates of social interaction at distance&rsquo; is a paper whose sole function is a&nbsp; re-analysis of the dataset - <a href=\"https://f1000research.com/articles/6-676/v1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Electrocortical correlations between pairs of isolated people: A reanalysis</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<br /><br /><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OKh73MT.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"616\" height=\"157\" /><br /></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In summary, there are a few things that help. Primarily, Metadata - and lots of it, a readme too! Both examples of re-use investigated above have a &lsquo;readme&rsquo; file or an &lsquo;instructions&rsquo; text file. Both of these datasets authors have therefore asked the question - Does this have enough metadata to be re-used as a single output?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the future, should we be recognising re-use by other authors to avoid datasets being cited by their authors in all their papers, even if not used? The company </span><a href=\"https://scite.ai/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scite</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is focussed on smart citations for better research, initially focussed on retractions and understanding the sentiment of citations. This seems to be a huge task for citing datasets going forward, to understand the &lsquo;why&rsquo; of each citation, in order to elucidate real meaning in citation counts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have any ideas of what level of transparency we should be focussing our efforts on here, or if you would like to explore this theme further, we&rsquo;d love to hear from you at </span><a href=\"mailto:info@figshare.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">info@figshare.com</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are looking for a data or paper repository, with citation counts and altmetrics scores like this, please get in touch at <a href=\"http://knowledge.figshare.com/institutions\">knowledge.figshare.com/institutions</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /><br /></span></p>", "categories": [], "isPublished": true, "isDraft": false, "isFeatured": false, "publicUrl": "https://figshare.com/blog/A_Peak_into_Dataset_Re-use/630", "publishedDate": "2021-06-01T11:51:13Z"}],

You can find this new area accessible with the User drop down menu.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Role restrictions&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This functionality is restricted to Institutional Administrators only.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The page itself</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the page, you can find two sections that will be outlined below, the </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Download Metadata </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">section and the </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upload Metadata and files </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">section.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JOUjMZZ.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"611\" /></span></p>\n<p><strong>Download metadata&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The output of this section will be a CSV containing the metadata of the requested items. This will be sent asynchronously in a zip file to your registered account email when it has been prepared.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are 2 main options to consider:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you want metadata of only public items or all items in any state (public/private/draft)?&nbsp;</span></li>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The state of the object will be shown in the download sheet&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you want the metadata of objects from across your whole repository or from specific groups only?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a variety of metadata across different groups, then each metadata field will be represented in each own column and will be empty for items that don&rsquo;t have those fields applied to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Upload metadata and files&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This section is used for both the creation of new items and the editing of existing items. You can choose to publish items or push the new changes or newly-created items straight to private. If you choose to publish, </span><strong>all items included in the upload sheet will be published.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your repository has the review module enabled, you can choose to automatically approve the items. This will not </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">skip </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the review process, but will create a Review entry and approve it from your login.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are creating new items, it&rsquo;s a good idea to download the existing metadata spreadsheet first. This way, you&rsquo;ll see all of the existing metadata fields and how they are organized. If you don&rsquo;t have any existing items to download, create a private item utilizing all of your fields to see what the upload sheet should look like.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only thing that will not be present on the download sheet that you may want on the upload sheet is </span><strong>files.</strong><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can attach files to items from any publicly available link (http and https), including FTP. To do this, you&rsquo;ll need to add a column that looks like this:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Header:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">files&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Example cell:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[\"</span><a href=\"https://journals.aqs.org/pdf/10.1103%22,%22ftp://mirror.easyname.at/ubuntu-releases/robots.txt\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://journals.aqs.org/pdf/10.1103\",\"ftp://mirror.easyname.at/ubuntu-releases/robots.txt</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This would upload two files, each from a different location, into one item.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have created and uploaded your sheet, we&rsquo;ll get to work on enacting the requested changes. Depending on the number of requested changes, this can take minutes to hours.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure that your requested changes are processed in the shortest possible amount of time, please make sure to only include in the sheet those items that you wish to update.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When these changes are complete, a success CSV will be sent to your registered email. This will outline any failures that may have occurred during the process. The row number in this will be the row the item was in the original upload sheet.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The editing and creation process works on an &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; approach per item, so even if only one aspect fails or is incorrect then no changes to the item will occur.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Some notes on the upload sheet</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating items on your own account can leave the account ID blank</span></li>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need the account IDs of users who have not created any items yet, you can use this endpoint: </span><a href=\"https://docs.figshare.com/#private_institution_accounts_list\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://docs.figshare.com/#private_institution_accounts_list</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Group ID, if you are publishing items to the default group, you can leave this field blank.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Group ID 0 is top level institution</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For other groups, you can get it from end point: </span><a href=\"https://docs.figshare.com/#private_institution_groups_list\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://docs.figshare.com/#private_institution_groups_list</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Funding search, you can use this endpoint: </span><a href=\"https://docs.figshare.com/#private_funding_search\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://docs.figshare.com/#private_funding_search</span></a></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DOI is ignored, handle is ignored, private link is ignored</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For &ldquo;Is embargoed&rdquo;,&nbsp; 0 = No, 1 = Yes</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;Embargo type&rdquo; is either file (files only) or article (embargoes the whole item, metadata and files)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;Embargo allowed administrators&rdquo; = 0 /1&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding an account ID will show that item is created via impersonation when investigating that item.

These achievements were made possible by building upon scientific research made openly available. There has been a major shift in the way research is shared: it&rsquo;s now more open and more reusable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Figshare, we&rsquo;re celebrating 10 years of making research data and other scholarly outputs openly available, accessible, reusable, and citable in the name of progressing scientific research. It began as a place for our Founder and Stem Cell Biologist, Mark Hahnel, to share his videos of stem cells and other non-traditional research outputs (NTROs) that formed part of his PhD research and get credit for them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a webinar celebrating our decade-long existence, Mark highlighted the achievements of the last ten years including the rise of Open Access and preprints and better access to literature and data.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;A decade ago, you couldn&rsquo;t publish 5MB videos in the supporting information section of publications,&rdquo; said Mark. Figshare now hosts nearly 6 million items including datasets, videos, software, presentations, papers, and more and is the repository solution of almost 200 universities, publishers, funders, government agencies, and pharmaceutical organizations all over the world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2011, the vision for Figshare was one of reducing the duplication of research carried out by the scientific community and publishing previously unpublished research. Figshare Alpha was a neon corner of the internet with a mission for advancing scientific research by sharing all research &mdash; nul results and all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We went through a few iterations of the platform over the next couple of years with various UI and UX designs but the message was always the same: get credit for your research, even if the data are negative.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QsbteDb.png[/img]\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"485\" /><br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2013, V1 launched as a freemium model with functionality to cite items published on Figshare &mdash; meaning they had a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) &mdash; plus users could use Figshare as private spaces to work on projects and publish them directly in Figshare when appropriate. It also included a GitHub integration making it possible for software to be assigned a DOI for citing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the next eight years, we developed a whole host of functionality based entirely on community feedback, funder/government/legal requirements, legal and regulatory requirements, and more to deliver repository infrastructure to organizations. Some of the key, groundbreaking features include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HR feed/SSO integrations and user management</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an </span><a href=\"https://www.altmetric.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Altmetric</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> integration</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DOI versioning</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a robust, fully-documented </span><a href=\"https://docs.figshare.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">API</span></a></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">advanced search capabilities</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">review module</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">advanced custom metadata</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a </span><a href=\"https://www.dimensions.ai/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dimensions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> integration to allow for funding links</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a </span><a href=\"https://www.readcube.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ReadCube</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> integration to view Open Access PDFs straight from the references section</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/02.01.02_60/en_301549v020102p.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EN 301 549</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WCAG 2.1 AA</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and </span><a href=\"https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Section 508</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> accessibility compliance</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">restricted publishing and requesting access</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sherpa Romeo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> integration for checking compliance with publisher policies on Open Access archiving</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s also worth celebrating the community that has flourished over the last decade. There have been countless Figshare Fests (our community user days), webinars, case studies, Slack conversations, and video calls among the community of organizations using Figshare. These have been for the sole purpose of sharing knowledge, best practices, and asking questions of each other to make each users&rsquo; experience better and more progressive for the sharing of scientific knowledge.</span><br /><br /><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GWz2hcg.png[/img]\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"487\" /><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ErrantScience/status/1229777621296320514,\">https://twitter.com/ErrantScience/status/1229777621296320514,</a><a href=\"https://errantscience.com/\"> https://errantscience.com/</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/figshare\">a 2014 interview with <em>Wired</em></a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Mark was asked where he saw the company and academia in ten years&rsquo; time. &ldquo;For us the Shangri-La is a world where a group of researchers generate new information based on new hypotheses, make it available on Figshare and then others pull together the combined world's knowledge to look for new patterns and discoveries that the original authors had not thought to look for. These data scientists will need tools, which we have already made available on our open API. I'd love to see more of these tools helping more people make more discoveries, more often.&rdquo; This is already happening &mdash; with the tracking of citations and Altmetrics on item pages, users can see who is mentioning and reusing their data and the progression that&rsquo;s had on scientific advancement. Take </span><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4654045\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this use case</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for example, of a University of Sheffield researcher who made his data available on Figshare and has since developed collaborations and new lines of enquiry into adjacent areas of research.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there&rsquo;s still a long way to go in some areas. &ldquo;Slightly frustrating for me is that while there has been innovation in the space, the majority of Open Access is Gold Open Access and not Green Open Access. This is just one area, we need to be focussing our attention, to make things more equitable,&rdquo; said Mark. &ldquo;I also thought we&rsquo;d solve the problem of sharing and getting credit for negative data. I don&rsquo;t think that problem has moved as fast as I&rsquo;d like; there&rsquo;s still a lot of valid negative data that doesn&rsquo;t get published.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we may have been quite inwardly focussed in the early days of Figshare, the Shangri-la vision seems more in-reach, albeit through a plethora of tools and repositories that have since emerged. Deepmind&rsquo;s Alphafold has recently demonstrated the power of well-curated, homogenous open data. When thinking of research data, future consumers will not just be human researchers &mdash; we also need to feed the machines. This means that computers will need to interpret content with little or no human intervention. For this to be possible, the outputs need to be in machine readable formats and the metadata needs to be sufficient to describe exactly what the data are and how the data was generated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We at Figshare will continue to support organizations in making life easy for their researchers to create, share, and store well-curated, homogenous open data.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s hope for even further progress in the next 10 years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">_______________________________________________________________</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We held a webinar recently celebrating 10 Years of Figshare, where our Founder and CEO, Mark Hahnel, looked back at the evolution of research management and our Product Director, Chris Blumzon, reflected on the features and functionality we&rsquo;ve developed in the last decade.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8jNW3j9.png[/img]\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"280\" /></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/recording/8215530413943661832\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch the webinar&nbsp;</span></a></p>", "categories": [], "isPublished": true, "isDraft": false, "isFeatured": true, "publicUrl": "https://figshare.com/blog/Ten_Years_of_Figshare_What_We_ve_Achieved_And_What_s_Next/653", "publishedDate": "2022-04-06T08:00:08Z"}, {"id": 650, "title": "Figshare awarded NIH Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative grant to enhance functionality for research community", "author": "Megan Hardeman", "excerpt": "<p>Figshare is pleased to participate in a new NIH initiative, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://datascience.nih.gov/news/nih-office-of-data-science-strategy-announces-new-initiative-to-improve-data-access\">Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative (GREI)</a>.

She concludes: &ldquo;researchers are left to navigate a system that makes it harder than not to share and where, most alarmingly, the public may only fully understand the importance of data sharing when it&rsquo;s shown to have gone dramatically wrong. There&rsquo;s no time to lose.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since 2016, we have monitored levels of data sharing and usage, and in this, our sixth survey, we asked about motivations as well as perceived discoverability and credibility of data that is shared openly.&nbsp; As 65% of respondents have never received credit or acknowledgement for sharing data, Barbour is correct that the incentives are not there to encourage sharing, and in order to improve this, the system needs to change.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Over 4,200 researchers from around the world completed the survey, reporting increasing concern about misuse of data as well as a lack of credit and acknowledgement for those who do openly share their data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of particular interest to </span><strong>universities</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may be the findings that 76% of survey respondents believe they currently get too little credit for sharing data while 30% said they would rely upon their institutional library for help making their research data openly available.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For </span><strong>publishers: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">47% of survey respondents said they would be motivated to share their data if there was a journal or publisher requirement to do so. 53% of survey respondents obtained research data collected by other research groups from within a published research article&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, </span><strong>funders</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may take note of the 52% of survey respondents who said funders should make the sharing of research data part of their requirements for awarding grants. Additionally, 48% of survey respondents said that funding should be withheld (or a penalty incurred) if researchers do not share their data when the funder has mandated that they do so at the grant application stage.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Government agencies</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may be interested to learn that 73% of survey respondents strongly or somewhat support the idea of a national mandate for making research data openly available. 33% would like more guidance on how to comply with government policies on making research data openly available.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other key findings are that:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">53% of survey respondents said it was extremely important that data are available from a publicly available repository</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">55% of survey respondents felt they needed support in regard to copyright and licenses when making research data openly available</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About a third of respondents indicated that they have reused their own or someone else&rsquo;s openly accessible data more during the pandemic than before</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our respondents will likely be researchers who are interested in the topic so we thought we would see support for mandates but we were surprised that more than half of people responding to the survey felt they needed support around copyright and licenses when making data available.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of great concern is the lack of credit and acknowledgement for sharing data. The traditional system rewards publishing of novel findings in journals, rather than the sharing of confirmatory or negative results or underlying data and other materials related to the research. This needs to change. The pandemic has shown that sharing of data openly increases progress and benefits society. This need not be limited to public health emergencies; there are many areas of research that bring direct benefits to society, not least that which addresses the current climate emergency. Opening up research is not the whole answer but it brings with it trust in science and this will be crucial as we move through the next decade and beyond.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Respondents&rsquo; motivations for data sharing are tied to traditional measurements of impact and credit, with 19% of respondents motivated by citation of their research papers, 14% by co-authorship on papers, 11% by increased impact and visibility of research, and 11% on public benefit. There are calls for credit systems to be put in place such as the </span><a href=\"https://www.aamc.org/what-we-do/mission-areas/medical-research/data-sharing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Credit for Data Sharing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> initiative, though nothing is widely implemented at present.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We first started asking about the </span><a href=\"https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FAIR</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> principles &mdash; ensuring data is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable &mdash; in 2018 and this is the fifth anniversary of the FAIR principles. Awareness and compliance is higher than in previous years and 28% of respondents say that they are familiar with the principles, and more than half (54%) thought their data was very much or somewhat compliant with FAIR data principles. These findings indicate that concern over sharing data could lessen in the long run if data are as accessible and reusable as possible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elsewhere in the report are essays on data curation for enhancing data and metadata quality and tips for engaging researchers in open data sharing practices.

To be as transparent as possible, nearly all of the DPC cost goes towards covering our costs to host this data securely and redundantly in the cloud. Many funders allow data sharing costs to be included in grant budgets, so you may be able to use grants funds to pay for Figshare+ and can include it in </span><a href=\"https://help.figshare.com/article/how-to-write-a-data-management-plan-dmp-and-include-figshare-in-your-data-sharing-plans\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">data management and sharing plans</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in funding proposals.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because we want researchers to get the most out of their open data, Figshare+ also offers additional license options and metadata compared to figshare.com.

If you need to get historic items into your ORCID account and they have not been captured by the existing Datacite integration, this will need to be done manually. <br /><br /><strong>Pull data from my ORCID to my Figshare account </strong><br /><br />This one is all about your figshare profile and your profile only. Nothing imported here will interact with your My Data area (that&rsquo;s where option 3 comes in).<br /><br />This will import everything in your ORCID works section to the publications area of your figshare profile. Unlike the previous setting, this will import everything&nbsp;<strong>before</strong> the integration was performed as well as anything created ongoing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/si4QWKZ.png[/img]\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"445\" /></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How publications look on a Figshare profile page.</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Create draft records from my ORCID data </strong><br /><br />This option is pretty cool even if I say so myself. It's especially useful for uploading open access versions of published works.<br /><br /><strong>After</strong> the integration has occurred, any new records created within the works section of your ORCID account will automatically create a new draft metadata record within your My Data area. We&rsquo;ll pull in as much available metadata as we can, as well as creating the metadata record with the DOI of the original object. Combining this with our new <a href=\"../blog/Sherpa_Romeo_integration_for_Figshare_for_Institutions/636\">Sherpa Romeo integration</a> makes for a very powerful workflow that makes the uploading of appropriate repository versions as slick as can be.<br /><br />Once a new draft item has been created from this integration, you&rsquo;ll get two kinds of notifications: an email to your account email address and a notification within the platform (coming October 2021). You can then choose to add a file for this record, such as an open access version of a publication, and any additional metadata or delete the draft record if it&rsquo;s not needed. <br /><br /><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/uehT6e8.png[/img]\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"286\" /><br /><br /><strong>Won&rsquo;t things get stuck in a loop?</strong></p>\n<p>Maybe you are reading this and thinking &ldquo;Hey! If I import something and it maintains the existing DOI and is then synched back to my ORCID works, won&rsquo;t that then be imported again and create an infinite loop?&rdquo;<br /><br />First of all, great question. Would you like a job at Figshare? Secondly, no, don&rsquo;t worry, due to some behind the scenes magic, these items won&rsquo;t be reimported. <br /><br /><strong>Will things continually create metadata records if I delete them as I don&rsquo;t want to make a repository version for that work?</strong><br /><br />No, things will only be imported once. If you delete them, it won&rsquo;t happen again. <br /><br /><strong>Are there any other implications of connecting my ORCID?</strong><br /><br />Nothing new, but it seems a good time to reiterate the current benefits of having an ORCID and connecting it to your Figshare account:<br /><br />- Your ORCID is part of the item&rsquo;s metadata <br />- Your ORCID is sent along with additional metadata when minting a DOI to a supporting partner such as DataCite<br />- You are searchable by your ORCID within Figshare<br />- Disambiguates your outputs to help with the I (interoperability) in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data\">F.A.I.R.</a><br />- Your ORCID is displayed on your <a href=\"https://help.figshare.com/article/maximise-your-research-profile\">Figshare Author</a> profile page<br /><br /><strong>Do I have to enable all three options? What if I don&rsquo;t enable any?</strong><br /><br />You don&rsquo;t have to enable any of the options. You&rsquo;ll still get all the great benefits listed above if you enable none of them. You can choose to enable any combination of the three, they all will work independently of each other. <br /><br /><strong>If I am using my institution&rsquo;s figshare and it doesn&rsquo;t allow the creation of items with a custom DOI, can I still create metadata records?</strong><br /><br />You can, but these will be created without the original published DOI. They will be published with a new DOI / handle based on your institution&rsquo;s policies. If you are unsure, speak to your institutional administrator about this. <br /><br /><strong>What if I&rsquo;ve already connected my ORCID to my Figshare account?</strong><br /><br />All of the benefits you currently enjoy under &ldquo;Are there any other implications of connecting my ORCID?&rdquo; outlined above that you get now will still continue to work without you doing anything. For any of the new functionality to work, we&rsquo;ll need new permissions from you. This means reauthorizing the ORCID application and away you go. <br /><br /><strong>How frequently are updates sent to ORCID from Figshare and vice versa?</strong><br /><br />With the power of webhooks, updates happen really quickly in a matter of minutes.</p>\n<p>If you have questions or want to discuss this further with a member of our team, please contact <a href=\"mailto:info@figshare.com\">info@figshare.com</a>.</p>", "categories": [], "isPublished": true, "isDraft": false, "isFeatured": true, "publicUrl": "https://figshare.com/blog/Something_old_something_new_Figshare_s_new_ORCID_integration_is_here/639", "publishedDate": "2021-08-31T14:42:54Z"}, {"id": 636, "title": "Sherpa Romeo integration for Figshare for Institutions", "author": "Alan Hyndman", "excerpt": "<p>We&rsquo;re really pleased to announce a Sherpa Romeo integration will be available to all of our Figshare for Institutions users as of September 1st, 2021.</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/H1SP51X.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"153\" /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or indeed, Figshare.
