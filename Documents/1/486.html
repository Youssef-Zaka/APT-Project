We all rely on online images for knowledge sharing, learning, and understanding. Even the largest websites are missing visual content and metadata to pair with their images. Captions and \u201C[alt text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Accessibility/Alternative_text_for_images)\u201D increase accessibility and enable better search. The majority of images on Wikipedia articles, for example, don\u0027t have any written context connected to the image. Open models could help anyone improve accessibility and learning for all.\n\nCurrent solutions rely on simple methods based on translations or page interlinks, which have limited coverage. Even the most advanced computer vision image captioning isn\u0027t suitable for images with complex semantics.\n\n\nIn this competition, you\u2019ll build a model that automatically retrieves the text closest to an image. Specifically, you\u0027ll train your model to associate given images with article titles or complex captions, in multiple languages. The best models will account for the semantic granularity of Wikipedia images.\n\nIf successful, you\u0027ll be contributing to the accessibility of the largest online encyclopedia. The millions of Wikipedia readers and editors will be able to more easily understand, search, and describe media at scale.
