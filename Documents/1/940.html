<ul><li>You know, one of the things that continues to bother us in the way in which the moderators don’t even bring up an issue that, before COVID-19, was impacting 43% of this nation. A hundred forty million people, before COVID, were poor and low-wealth, and 62 million people working for less than a living wage. And since COVID, we know that millions have been added to the poverty and low-wealth numbers. We’re well over 50% because of the new poor. We know we had 87 million people before COVID that were either uninsured or underinsured, and now some 20 million people have been added because of people who have lost their insurance because they’ve lost their jobs. Forty percent of the jobs that make $40,000 a year have been lost.

<ul><li>We have to stop saying things were well before COVID. It’s almost as though we give that away to the Trump and Pence. The reality is, Wall Street was well. The reality is, those who got his tax cuts were well. The reality is, though, that before COVID, they were trying to overturn healthcare. Before COVID, they were blocking living wages. Before COVID, we were not addressing the issue of poor and low-wealth people.

<ul><li>When we look at COVID-19, we know that the fissures of systemic racism and systemic poverty have actually allowed this pandemic to have a greater hold on our American society. We know that when we talk about death, we have to be exact, that it’s not just people are dying, poor people are dying. People who make less than $50,000 a year are dying. People are dying who are among the poor, whether it be white, Black —disproportionately among Black and Brown and Indigenous people, and that COVID has killed more people in the U.S. than Americans were killed in battle in five of our most recent wars — Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, the War in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf War. I mean, this is what we’re talking about when we’re talking about this devastation that’s happening among poor and low-wealth people.

<ul><li>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been caught on numerous occasions engaging in statistical manipulation in order to drive up a perpetual state of fear among Americans – all with the aim of coaxing people to get the Covid-19 ‘vaccine.’ But one thing the CDC appears entirely unwilling to do is to document the ways that natural immunity has made the vaccines redundant at best, and harmful at worst, for those who were previously infected.

<ul><li>Like humans, pathogens do not respect species boundaries. Overall, nearly eight billion people, many with advanced technologies and rapacious appetites, are tearing ecosystems apart and within these ecosystems live millions of different kinds of viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Shah" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Sonia Shah">Sonia Shah</a> observes in her book <i>Pandemic</i>, society operates with an erroneous paradigm of disease, treating diseases as foreign invaders into our territory (a mentality she describes as “microbial xenophobia”), when in fact we are the invading species encroaching on the habitat and communities of animals and ecosystems. It is wrong to say that these diseases are happening to us, rather they are the unintended results of what we are doing to the natural world. Speculations about accidental laboratory origins of outbreaks and COVID-19 conspiracy plots of bioterrorism draw attention away from actual systemic structures and dynamics of human exploitation of nature, especially as driven by the growth-addicted world system of <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>. Hardly unexpected or accidental, viral outbreaks are the inevitable consequences of human growth and expansion. All too often, we are the causes, not effects, the culprits, not victims, of pandemic-inducing pathogens.

<ul><li>From the beginning of my presidency, I’ve been very clear-eyed that we need to attack this virus globally, not just at home, because it’s in America’s self-interest to do so. <br /> The virus knows no boundaries.  You can’t build a wall high enough to keep it out.

<ul><li>The next level of covid escalation is questioning the justified existence of citizens that refuse to be vaccinated. It is with some irony that we are seeing the expert class increasingly sound like dissident political pundit Stefan Molyneux: “The time for arguments has passed.” Any concerns that once existed about the individual rights of those concerned about covid vaccines—including those who have a natural immunity to the virus from prior exposures—are quickly being dismissed by those in power.

<ul><li>This pandemic is not just a crisis, it's also a gift. It allows us the oxygen to notice the things we've been ignoring were the truly essential:<br />– Learning and creating<br />– Enjoying clean water, clean air, clean food, and making sure every human has that right<br />– Forming a world that will last longer than an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_regular_season" class="extiw" title="w:NFL regular season">NFL season</a><br />– Spending a lot of time with your beautiful family (or a little time with an unsightly one)<br />Point is — the stuff that truly matters is the stuff we were completely ignoring, blithely pushing it to the back of our minds as our planet is eaten for corporate profit. But now, during "life on hold" the natural world reclaims spaces. Beaches around the globe teem with millions of birds and wildlife, no longer flooded by undulating masses of fleshy apes with our frisbees, and snorkels, and beer coolers and entitlement.

<ul><li>Like <a href="/wiki/Cancer" title="Cancer">cancer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> grows until it murders the host body. During this pandemic shutdown, it's not getting the growth it needs and parts of it are becoming benign... For years...we've been lost in the frenetic pace of lives based on non-events, never pausing to reassess or recess. The spastic motion of avoidance filled the ether — afraid if we stop to truly think about it, we may find our scant few years of <a href="/wiki/Consciousness" title="Consciousness">consciousness</a> are pissed away as slaves at often meaningless jobs. They, the pustulant corporate owners, suck away our lives... And now, with life on holiday, we see almost none of it was essential... As our planet disintegrates under the weight of consumption and greed, most people are trapped in extreme poverty. And that's how the system of capitalism is designed. Slightly altering capitalism will not change this reality... If we take away the false promises of capitalism and just say to people, "Private luxury is only for a few humans. You will never have it and won't even have the chance at getting it" – if we admit that – then the entire justification for capitalism evaporates... The pandemic shutdown has shown us the problem. It has revealed what the world looks like without as much pollution, without the chaos and roar of mostly meaningless "work" performed by the exploited, using materials stolen from the abused, for the benefit of the pampered and oblivious.

<ul><li>Covid-19 has revealed glaring failures and monstrous brutalities in the current capitalist system. It represents both a crisis and an opportunity. Contests for controlling the narratives around the meaning of this pandemic will be the terrain of struggle for either a new, more humane common sense and society or a return to the status quo ante. The outcome of those contests is uncertain; everything depends on the actions that people take into their hands.

<ul><li>Covid has switched from just being a disease that may kill off portions of a firm’s workforce to a useful political weapon. It is a political weapon.

Citi itself likely has a significant slice of employees working remote. What purpose does it serve but to fire politically unreliable employees?

<ul><li>Humanity continues to suffer as COVID-19 spreads around the world. In 2020 alone, this novel disease killed 1.7 million people and sickened at least 70 million more. The pandemic reveals just how unprepared and unwilling countries and the international system are to handle global emergencies properly. In this time of crisis, governments too often abdicated responsibility, ignored scientific advice, cooperated or communicated ineffectively, and consequently failed to protect the public health and welfare of their citizens.

<ul><li>The most commonly reported <a href="/wiki/Mainstream_media" title="Mainstream media">mainstream media</a> account of the creation of the Coronavirus suggests that it was derived from an animal borne microorganism... But there appears to be some evidence to dispute that... Because of that and other factors, there has also been considerable speculation that the Coronavirus did not occur naturally through mutation but rather was produced in a laboratory, possibly as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biological_warfare" class="extiw" title="w:biological warfare">biological warfare agent.</a><br />Several reports suggest that there are components of the virus that are related to <a href="/wiki/HIV/AIDS" title="HIV/AIDS">HIV</a> that could not have occurred naturally.

<ul><li>There is, of course and inevitably, another theory. There has been some speculation that as the Trump Administration has been constantly raising the issue of growing Chinese global competitiveness as a direct threat to American national security and economic dominance, it must might be possible that Washington has created and unleashed the virus in a bid to bring Beijing's growing economy and military might down a few notches. It is, to be sure, hard to believe that even the Trump White House would do something so reckless, but there are precedents for that type of behavior.

<ul><li>Those of us now in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(health_care)" class="extiw" title="w:Isolation (health care)">isolation</a>, in spite of our fear and frustrations, in spite of our grief ⁠— for those who have died or may die, for the life we once lived, for the future we once hoped for ⁠— there is also a sense we are cocooned, transforming, waiting, dreaming. True: Terrors stalk the global landscape, notably the way the virus ⁠— or our countermeasures ⁠— will endanger those among us whom we, as a society, have already abandoned or devalued. So many of us are already disposable. So many of us are only learning it now, too late. Then there is the dangerous blurring of the line between <a href="/wiki/Humanitarian" class="mw-redirect" title="Humanitarian">humanitarian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Authoritarian" class="mw-redirect" title="Authoritarian">authoritarian</a> measures. There is the geopolitical weaponization of the pandemic. But when the Spring comes, as it must, when we emerge from hibernation, it might be a time of profound global struggle against both the drive to "return <a href="/wiki/Status_quo" title="Status quo">to normal</a>" ⁠— the same normal that set the stage for this tragedy ⁠— and the "new normal" which might be even worse. Let us prepare as best we can, for we have a world to win.
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Max_Haiven" title="Max Haiven">Max Haiven</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://roarmag.org/essays/no-return-to-normal-for-a-post-pandemic-liberation/">"No return to normal: for a post-pandemic liberation"</a> (23 March 2020), <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROAR_Magazine" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ROAR Magazine">ROAR Magazine</a></i></li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>After months of chaos, isolation and fear, the desire to return to normal, even if normal is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_abuse" class="extiw" title="w:Structural abuse">abusive system</a>, may be extremely strong. The stage is set for this desire to be accompanied by a frantic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revanchism" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:revanchism">revanchism</a>. Will we want someone to blame, especially those of us who lose loved ones? Must there be blood, figurative or literal?: a baptism by fire so that the old order ⁠— which, of course, created the conditions of <a href="/wiki/Austerity" title="Austerity">austerity</a> and <a href="/wiki/Inequality" class="mw-redirect" title="Inequality">inequality</a> that made this plague so devastating⁠ — can be reborn in purified form. Of course, things will never be "normal" again: some of us, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_privilege" class="extiw" title="w:Social privilege">privileged</a> and wealthy, may be afforded the illusion, but this illusion is likely to be carried on the backs of the vast majority who will work harder, longer and for less, suffer greater risks and fewer rewards. The <a href="/wiki/Debts" class="mw-redirect" title="Debts">debts</a> of the pandemic, literal and figurative, will have to be repaid. On the other hand ⁠— or maybe at the same time ⁠— we can also expect that, among <a href="/wiki/Elite" title="Elite">the powerful</a> and among the rest of us, there will be calls to reject the "return to normal," but in order to embrace something even worse. It is likely that the chaos and deaths of the pandemic will be blamed on too much <a href="/wiki/Democracy" title="Democracy">democracy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Liberalism" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Empathy" title="Empathy">empathy</a>. Now that states are flexing their muscles and <a href="/wiki/Totalitarianism" title="Totalitarianism">taking full command</a> of <a href="/wiki/Society" title="Society">society</a>, there will be many who do not want the sleeve to be rolled back down. We may yet see, in this crisis, the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_repression" class="extiw" title="w:Political repression">repressive</a> force on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civilian" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:civilian">civilians</a> ⁠— as it is already being used on <a href="/wiki/Immigration#Discrimination" title="Immigration">migrants</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_abuse" class="extiw" title="w:Prisoner abuse">incarcerated people</a> ⁠— and I fear that it will be seen by many as justified, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_sacrifice" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:human sacrifice">human sacrifice</a> to feed the Gods of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_fear#In_politics" class="extiw" title="w:Culture of fear">fear</a>. In the wake of the pandemic we can be sure that <a href="/wiki/Fascists" class="mw-redirect" title="Fascists">fascists</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reactionaries" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:reactionaries">reactionaries</a> will seek to mobilize tropes of ⁠— racial, national, economic ⁠— purity, purification, parasitism, and pollution to impose their long-festering dreams on reality.

<ul><li>Against all these fateful outcomes there will be those among us who refuse to return to normal, or to embrace the "new normal," those of us who know that "the trouble with normal is it only gets worse." Already, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_of_emergency" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:state of emergency">state of emergency</a> that the crisis has unleashed, we are seeing extraordinary measures emerge that reveal that much of the <a href="/wiki/Neoliberal" class="mw-redirect" title="Neoliberal">neoliberal</a> regime's claims to necessity and austerity were transparent lies. The God-like market has fallen, again. In different places a variety of measures are being introduced that would have been unimaginable even weeks ago. These have included the suspension of rents and mortgages, the free provision of public transit, the deployment of basic incomes, a hiatus in debt payments, the commandeering of privatized hospitals and other once-public infrastructure for the public good, the liberation of incarcerated people, and governments compelling private industries to reorient production to common needs. We hear news of significant numbers of people <a href="/wiki/Refusing_to_work" class="mw-redirect" title="Refusing to work">refusing to work</a>, taking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcat_strike_action" class="extiw" title="w:Wildcat strike action">wildcat labor action</a>, and demanding their right to live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_politics" class="extiw" title="w:Radical politics">radical</a> ways. In some places, the underhoused are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squatting" class="extiw" title="w:Squatting">seizing vacant homes</a>. We are discovering, against the upside-down capitalist value paradigm which has enriched the few at the expense of the many, whose labor is truly valuable: care, service, and frontline public sector workers. There has been a proliferation of <a href="/wiki/Grassroots_movement" title="Grassroots movement">grassroots</a> radical demands for policies of care and <a href="/wiki/Solidarity" title="Solidarity">solidarity</a> not only as emergency measures, but in perpetuity.
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Max_Haiven" title="Max Haiven">Max Haiven</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://roarmag.org/essays/no-return-to-normal-for-a-post-pandemic-liberation/">"No return to normal: for a post-pandemic liberation"</a> (23 March 2020), <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROAR_Magazine" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ROAR Magazine">ROAR Magazine</a></i></li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>Meanwhile, the quarantined and semi-isolated are discovering, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_activism" class="extiw" title="w:Internet activism">using digital tools</a>, new ways to mobilize to provide care and <a href="/wiki/Mutual_aid_(organization_theory)" title="Mutual aid (organization theory)">mutual aid</a> to those in our communities in need. We are slowly recovering our lost powers of life in common, hidden in plain sight, our secret inheritance. We are learning again to become a <a href="/wiki/Cooperation" title="Cooperation">cooperative</a> species, shedding the claustrophobic skin of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homo_oeconomicus" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:homo oeconomicus">homo oeconomicus</a>. In the suspension of a capitalist order of competition, distrust and endless, pointless hustle, our ingenuity and <a href="/wiki/Compassion" title="Compassion">compassion</a> are resurfacing like the birds to the smog-free sky. When the Spring arrives, the struggle will be to preserve, enhance, network and organize this ingenuity and compassion to demand no return to normal and no new normal. [...] We have learned how to bring a capitalist economy to its knees through <a href="/wiki/Non-violent_protest" class="mw-redirect" title="Non-violent protest">non-violent protest</a> in the face of overwhelming, technologically augmented oppression. We are learning how to become ungovernable by either states or markets. Equally important, we have learned new ways to care for one another without waiting for the state or for <a href="/wiki/Authorities" class="mw-redirect" title="Authorities">authorities</a>. We are rediscovering the power of mutual aid and solidarity. We are learning how to communicate and cooperate anew. We have learned how to organize and to respond quickly, how to make collective decisions and to take responsibility for our fate. Like the heroes of all good epics, we are not ready, our training was not completed, yet fate will not wait. Like all true heroes, we must make do with what we have: one another and nothing else. As the world closes its eyes for this strange, dreamlike quarantine ⁠— save of course for those frontline health, service and care workers who, in the service of humanity, cannot rest, or those who have no safe place to dream ⁠— we must make ready for the waking. We are on the cusp of a great refusal of a return to normal and of a new normal, a vengeful normalcy that brought us this catastrophe and that will only lead to more catastrophe. In the weeks to come, it will be time to mourn and to dream, to prepare, to learn, and to connect as best we can. When the isolation is over, we will awaken to a world where competing regimes of vindictive normalization will be at war with one another, a time of profound danger and opportunity. It will be a time to rise and to look one another in the eye.

<ul><li>In the face of the COVID-19 tsunami, our lives are changing in ways that were inconceivable just a few short weeks ago. Not since the <a href="/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308" title="Financial crisis of 2007–08">2008–9 economic collapse</a> has the world collectively shared an experience of this kind: a single, rapidly mutating global <a href="/wiki/Crisis" title="Crisis">crisis</a>, structuring the rhythm of our daily lives within a complex calculus of risk and competing probabilities. In response, numerous <a href="/wiki/Social_movements" class="mw-redirect" title="Social movements">social movements</a> have put forward demands that take seriously the potentially disastrous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_politics" class="extiw" title="w:Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on politics">consequences</a> of the virus, while also tackling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_responses_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic" class="extiw" title="w:National responses to the COVID-19 pandemic">the incapacity</a> of <a href="/wiki/Capitalist" class="mw-redirect" title="Capitalist">capitalist</a> governments to adequately <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_management" class="extiw" title="w:Crisis management">address the crisis</a> itself. These demands include questions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_safety" class="extiw" title="w:Workplace safety">worker safety</a>, the necessity of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_organizing" class="extiw" title="w:Community organizing">neighborhood-level organizing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/income" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:income">income</a> and <a href="/wiki/Social_security" title="Social security">social security</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_rights" class="extiw" title="w:Labor rights">rights</a> of those on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zero-hour_contract" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:zero-hour contract">zero-hour contracts</a> or in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precarious_work" class="extiw" title="w:Precarious work">precarious employment</a>, and the need to protect renters and those living in <a href="/wiki/Poverty" title="Poverty">poverty</a>.

<ul><li>In this sense, the COVID-19 crisis has sharply underscored the irrational nature of <a href="/wiki/Health_care" title="Health care">health care</a> systems <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_industry" class="extiw" title="w:Healthcare industry">structured</a> around <a href="/wiki/Corporation" class="mw-redirect" title="Corporation">corporate</a> <a href="/wiki/Profit" title="Profit">profit</a> — the almost universal cutbacks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_hospital" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:public hospital">public hospital</a> staffing and infrastructure (including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit" class="extiw" title="w:Intensive care unit">critical care beds</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ventilator" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ventilator">ventilators</a>), the lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_health" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:public health">public health</a> provision and the prohibitive cost of access to medical services in many countries, and the ways in which the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_rights_(economics)" class="extiw" title="w:Property rights (economics)">property rights</a> of <a href="/wiki/Pharmaceutical_companies" class="mw-redirect" title="Pharmaceutical companies">pharmaceutical companies</a> serve to restrict widespread access to potential therapeutic treatments and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine#Economics_of_development" class="extiw" title="w:Vaccine">development of vaccines</a>. However, the global dimensions of COVID-19 have figured less prominently in much of the left discussion. [...] Even inside <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Europe" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic in Europe">Europe</a> there is extreme unevenness in the capacity of states to deal with this crisis — as the juxtaposition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Germany" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic in Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Greece" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic in Greece">Greece</a> illustrates — but a much greater disaster is about to envelop the rest of the world. In response, our perspective on this pandemic must become truly global, based on an understanding of how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_health" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:public health">public health</a> aspects of this virus intersect with larger questions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic" class="extiw" title="w:Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic">political economy</a> (including the likelihood of a prolonged and severe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_recession" class="extiw" title="w:Coronavirus recession">global economic downturn</a>). This is not the time to pull up the (national) hatches and speak simply of the fight against the virus inside our own borders.

<ul><li>As with all so-called <a href="/wiki/Humanitarian_crises" class="mw-redirect" title="Humanitarian crises">humanitarian crises</a>, it is essential to remember that the social conditions found across most of the countries of the South are the direct product of how these states are inserted into the <a href="/wiki/Hierarchies" class="mw-redirect" title="Hierarchies">hierarchies</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_market" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:world market">world market</a>. Historically, this included a long encounter with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world" class="extiw" title="w:Western world">Western</a> <a href="/wiki/Colonialism" title="Colonialism">colonialism</a>, which has continued, <a href="/wiki/Neocolonialism" title="Neocolonialism">into contemporary times</a>, with the subordination of <a href="/wiki/Developing_country" title="Developing country">poorer countries</a> to the interests of the world's <a href="/wiki/Developed_country" title="Developed country">wealthiest states</a> and largest <a href="/wiki/Transnational_corporations" class="mw-redirect" title="Transnational corporations">transnational corporations</a>. [...] Foregrounding these historical and global dimensions helps make clear that the enormous scale of the current crisis is not simply a question of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology" class="extiw" title="w:Virology">viral</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epidemiology" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:epidemiology">epidemiology</a> and a lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biological_resistance" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:biological resistance">biological resistance</a> to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/novel_pathogen" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:novel pathogen">novel pathogen</a>. The ways that most people across <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Africa" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic in Africa">Africa</a>, Latin America, the Middle East, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Asia" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic in Asia">Asia</a> will experience the coming pandemic is a direct consequence of a <a href="/wiki/Global_economy" class="mw-redirect" title="Global economy">global economy</a> systemically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_colonialism" class="extiw" title="w:Exploitation colonialism">structured around</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_of_natural_resources" class="extiw" title="w:Exploitation of natural resources">exploitation of the resources</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_of_labour" class="extiw" title="w:Exploitation of labour">peoples</a> of the South. In this sense, the pandemic is very much a social and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropogenic_hazard" class="extiw" title="w:Anthropogenic hazard">human-made disaster</a> — not simply a calamity arising from natural or biological causes. One clear example of how this disaster is human-made is the poor state of public <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/health_system" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:health system">health systems</a> across most countries in the South, which tend to be underfunded and <a href="/wiki/Shortages_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic" title="Shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic">lacking</a> in adequate medicines, equipment, and staff. This is particularly significant for understanding the threat presented by COVID-19 due to the rapid and very large surge in serious and critical cases that typically require hospital admission as a result of the virus (currently estimated at around 15–20 percent of confirmed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#Cases" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic">cases</a>). This fact is now widely discussed in the context of Europe and the <a href="/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States" title="COVID-19 pandemic in the United States">United States</a>, and lies behind the strategy of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatten_the_curve" class="extiw" title="w:Flatten the curve">flattening the curve</a>" in order to alleviate the pressure on hospital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit" class="extiw" title="w:Intensive care unit">critical care capacity</a>.

<ul><li>Yet, while we rightly point to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortages_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic#Intensive_care_beds" class="extiw" title="w:Shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic">lack of ICU beds</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortages_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic#Mechanical_ventilation" class="extiw" title="w:Shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic">ventilators</a>, and trained medical staff across many Western states, we must recognize that the situation in most of the rest of the world is immeasurably worse. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Malawi" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic in Malawi">Malawi</a>, for example, has about 25 ICU beds for a population of 17 million people. There are less than 2.8 critical care beds per 100,000 people on average across <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_South_Asia" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic in South Asia">South Asia</a>, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Bangladesh" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> possessing around 1,100 such beds for a population of over 157 million (0.7 critical care beds per 100,000 people). In comparison, the shocking pictures coming out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Italy" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic in Italy">Italy</a> are occurring in an advanced <a href="/wiki/Health_care" title="Health care">health care</a> system with an average 12.5 ICU beds per 100,000 (and the ability to bring more online). The situation is so serious that many <a href="/wiki/Poorer_countries" class="mw-redirect" title="Poorer countries">poorer countries</a> do not even have information on ICU availability. [...] Of course, the question of ICU and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_hospital_beds" class="extiw" title="w:List of countries by hospital beds">hospital capacity</a> is one part of a much larger set of issues including a widespread lack of basic resources (e.g., clean water, food, and electricity), adequate access to primary medical care, and the presence of other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comorbidities" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:comorbidities">comorbidities</a> (such as high rates of <a href="/wiki/HIV" class="mw-redirect" title="HIV">HIV</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tuberculosis" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>). Taken as a whole, all of these factors will undoubtedly mean a vastly higher prevalence of critically ill patients (and hence overall fatalities) across poorer countries as a result of COVID-19.

<ul><li>Debates around how best to respond to COVID-19 in Europe and the United States have illustrated the mutually reinforcing relationship between effective public health measures and conditions of labor, <a href="/wiki/Precarity" title="Precarity">precarity</a>, and poverty. Calls for people to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#Self-isolation" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic">self-isolate</a> when sick — or the enforcement of longer periods of mandatory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_lockdowns" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns">lockdowns</a> — are economically impossible for the many people who cannot easily shift their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommuting" class="extiw" title="w:Telecommuting">work online</a>, or those in the service sector who work in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zero-hour_contracts" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:zero-hour contracts">zero-hour contracts</a> or other kinds of <a href="/wiki/Temporary_employment" class="mw-redirect" title="Temporary employment">temporary employment</a>. Recognizing the fundamental consequences of these work patterns for public health, many European governments have announced sweeping promises around compensation for those made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic#Unemployment" class="extiw" title="w:Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic">unemployed</a> or forced to stay at home during this crisis. It remains to be seen how effective these schemes will be, and to what degree they will actually meet the needs of the very large numbers of people who will lose their jobs as a result of the crisis. Nonetheless, we must recognize that such schemes will simply not exist for most of the world's population. In countries where the majority of the labor force is engaged in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/informal_work" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:informal work">informal work</a> or depends upon unpredictable daily wages — much of the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Asia — there is no feasible way that people can choose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing_measures_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic" class="extiw" title="w:Social distancing measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic">to stay home or self-isolate</a>. This must be viewed alongside the fact that there will almost certainly be very large increases in the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/working_poor" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:working poor">working poor</a>" as a direct result of the crisis.

Reeling from thirteen years of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip" class="extiw" title="w:Blockade of the Gaza Strip">Israeli siege</a> and the systematic destruction of essential infrastructure, living conditions in the Strip are marked by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extreme_poverty" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:extreme poverty">extreme poverty</a>, poor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_the_State_of_Palestine" class="extiw" title="w:Water supply and sanitation in the State of Palestine">sanitation</a>, and a chronic lack of drugs and medical equipment (there are, for example, only sixty-two ventilators in Gaza, and just fifteen of these are currently available for use). Under blockade and closure for most of the past decade, Gaza has been shut to the world long before the current pandemic. The region could be the proverbial canary in the COVID-19 coalmine — foreshadowing the future path of the infection among refugee communities across the Middle East and elsewhere.

<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Putin" title="Vladimir Putin">Vladimir Putin</a>'s government has also been accused of downplaying the severity of the outbreak. Officially, there have been 2,337 cases <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Russia" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic in Russia">in Russia</a>—very low by international standards—but low testing rates make it hard to know for sure. Critics suggest that a suspiciously nationwide uptick in pneumonia cases in recent weeks actually consists of undiagnosed <a href="/wiki/COVID-19" class="mw-redirect" title="COVID-19">COVID-19</a> cases. Aggressive measures put in place to punish the spread of "false" information on the outbreak online may also be preventing media outlets from publishing accurate information. After moving much more slowly than other governments to order lockdowns and social distancing measures, Russia is finally implementing new rules as the number of cases has grown rapidly in recent days. Putin, who was highly visible while touting the government's efforts to contain the disease's spread early on, was conspicuously absent when it was time to deliver the bad news. The impending crisis has not stopped Russia's government from scoring a propaganda coup by shipping medical supplies to other countries—including the <a href="/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States" title="COVID-19 pandemic in the United States">U.S</a>.

<ul><li>What we have witnessed so far is cause for alarm. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutionalized_discrimination" class="extiw" title="w:Institutionalized discrimination">institutional</a> <a href="/wiki/Xenophobia" title="Xenophobia">xenophobia</a> of the state form is becoming especially manifest just as we are gaining increasing awareness of the lethal danger the virus poses for all humanity. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Europe" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic in Europe">European</a> states responded to the initial spread of the coronavirus in a totally uncoordinated fashion. Very quickly, most European states — <a href="/wiki/Central_Europe" class="mw-redirect" title="Central Europe">Central Europe</a> in particular — locked themselves behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_law" class="extiw" title="w:Administrative law">administrative</a> walls of their national <a href="/w/index.php?title=Territory&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Territory (page does not exist)">territory</a> in order to protect their population from the "foreign virus," and the first countries in Europe to cloister themselves in were also the most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia#Europe" class="extiw" title="w:Xenophobia">xenophobic</a>. This set the tone throughout Europe and the rest of the world: every state must look after their own — to the delight of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extreme_right" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:extreme right">extreme right</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics#Europe" class="extiw" title="w:Far-right politics">in Europe</a> and elsewhere. And nothing has been more abject than the lack of <a href="/wiki/Solidarity" title="Solidarity">solidarity</a> with the most affected countries. Italy's abandonment by France and Germany — who pushed selfishness to new heights by refusing to send Italy medical equipment and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic" class="extiw" title="w:Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic">protective masks</a> — sounded the death knell for a Europe built on a foundation of generalized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortages_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic#Competition_for_supplies" class="extiw" title="w:Shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic">competition</a> between states.

<ul><li>The <a href="/wiki/WHO" class="mw-redirect" title="WHO">WHO</a> has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization#Financing_and_partnerships" class="extiw" title="w:World Health Organization">financially weakened</a> for the past several decades, and is now largely dependent on private donors, with 80 percent of its funding coming from private businesses or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_foundation" class="extiw" title="w:Private foundation">foundations</a>. But despite its weakened condition, the WHO could have still provided an initial framework for global <a href="/wiki/Cooperation" title="Cooperation">cooperation</a> in the fight against the pandemic, not only because of the reliable information it had gathered since the beginning of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_January_2020" class="extiw" title="w:Timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in January 2020">January</a>, but also because its recommendations for radical and early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection_prevention_and_control" class="extiw" title="w:Infection prevention and control">control</a> of the epidemic were ultimately correct. According to the <a href="/wiki/Tedros_Adhanom" title="Tedros Adhanom">Director-General of the WHO</a>, the choice to abandon systematic <a href="/wiki/COVID-19_testing" title="COVID-19 testing">testing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_surveillance" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 surveillance">contract tracing</a>, which were effective in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_South_Korea" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea">Korea</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Taiwan" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, was a major mistake that contributed to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019#Transmission" class="extiw" title="w:Coronavirus disease 2019">spread of the virus</a> in virtually every country. The ultimate cause of this alarming delay were strategic choices. Italy was quickly forced to adopt a strategy of absolute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_lockdown_in_Italy" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Italy">confinement</a> in order to halt the epidemic, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_lockdown_in_Hubei" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Hubei">China</a> had previously done. Other countries waited far too long to react, largely on the basis of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fatalist" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:fatalist">fatalist</a> and crypto-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism" class="extiw" title="w:Social Darwinism">Darwinian</a> strategy of "<a href="/wiki/Herd_immunity" title="Herd immunity">herd immunity</a>." <a href="/wiki/Boris_Johnson" title="Boris Johnson">Boris Johnson</a>'s <a href="/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> was entirely passive in its initial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_Kingdom#Government_response" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom">approach</a>, and other countries equivocated and delayed their restrictive measures, such as France and Germany, not to mention the <a href="/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_the_United_States" class="mw-redirect" title="2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States">United States</a>.
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Christian_Laval" title="Christian Laval">Christian Laval</a> and Pierre Dardot, <i><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://roarmag.org/essays/dardot-laval-corona-pandemic/">The pandemic as political trial: the case for a global commons</a></i> (March 28, 2020), <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROAR_Magazine" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ROAR Magazine">ROAR Magazine</a></i></li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>By adopting a strategy of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic_prevention#Prevention_versus_mitigation" class="extiw" title="w:Pandemic prevention">mitigation</a>," or epidemic delay by "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flattening_the_curve" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:flattening the curve">flattening the curve</a>," these countries have de facto renounced any serious attempt to keep the virus under control from the start through the use of systematic screening and general confinement of the population, as was done in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Wuhan">Wuhan</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Hubei" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic in Hubei">Hubei</a> province. According to the forecasts of the German and French governments, the strategy of collective immunity necessitates 50 to 80 percent contamination across the entire population. This amounts to accepting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#Deaths" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic">deaths</a> of hundreds of thousands — even millions — of people who are supposedly the "most fragile." All the while, the WHO's recommendations were very clear: states must not abandon systematic screening and contact tracing of anyone who tests positive for the virus.

<ul><li>What has since become abundantly apparent is the destructive influence of <a href="/wiki/Behavioral_economics" title="Behavioral economics">behavioral economics</a> and the so-called "<a href="/wiki/Nudge_theory" title="Nudge theory">nudge theory</a>" of political <a href="/wiki/Decision-making" title="Decision-making">decision-making</a>, which relies on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/incentives" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:incentives">incentives</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(psychology)" class="extiw" title="w:Stimulus (psychology)">stimuli</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_change_(individual)" class="extiw" title="w:Behavior change (individual)">to steer individual behavior</a>, rather than <a href="/wiki/Coercion" title="Coercion">coercion</a> or restraint. We now know that the "nudge unit," or the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_Insights_Team" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Behavioural Insights Team">Behavioural Insights Team</a>," that advises the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:British Government">British Government</a> successfully convinced the state of their theory that individuals who are too quickly constrained by severe measures will tire and relax their discipline when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic_curve" class="extiw" title="w:Epidemic curve">epidemic</a> reaches its peak, which is precisely when discipline is needed most. Since 2010, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Thaler" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Richard Thaler">Richard Thaler</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Economic_theory" class="mw-redirect" title="Economic theory">economic theory</a> — which he outlines in the book <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_(book)" class="extiw" title="w:Nudge (book)">Nudge</a></i> (2009) — is widely thought to be the best means for producing "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance#Effective_governance" class="extiw" title="w:Governance">efficient state governance</a>." This approach tells us to encourage people, without coercing them, to make the best decisions through the use of "nudges": by using gentle, indirect, comfortable and optional <a href="/wiki/Social_influence" title="Social influence">influences</a> upon individuals who are still ultimately <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_choice" class="mw-redirect" title="Freedom of choice">free to make their own choices</a>. The application of this "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libertarian_paternalism" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:libertarian paternalism">libertarian paternalism</a>" in the fight against the epidemic has been two-fold: (a) the rejection of any coercive measures to regulate individual <a href="/wiki/Human_behavior" title="Human behavior">behavior</a> and (b) a preference for "barrier gestures": <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing_measures_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic" class="extiw" title="w:Social distancing measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic">keep your distance</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hand_washing" title="Hand washing">wash your hands</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#Face_masks_and_respiratory_hygiene" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic">cough into your elbow</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#Self-isolation" class="extiw" title="w:COVID-19 pandemic">self-isolate</a> if you have a fever and all for your own benefit. This wager to rely on soft, voluntary measures was risky: there is no scientific or empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in the context of an epidemic. And it is now all too clear that this approach entirely failed.
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Christian_Laval" title="Christian Laval">Christian Laval</a> and Pierre Dardot, <i><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://roarmag.org/essays/dardot-laval-corona-pandemic/">The pandemic as political trial: the case for a global commons</a></i> (March 28, 2020), <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROAR_Magazine" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ROAR Magazine">ROAR Magazine</a></i></li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>The <a href="/wiki/Public_service" title="Public service">public service</a> is a mechanism by which the governors become the servants of the governed. These obligations, which are imposed on those who govern as well as the agents of government, form the basis of what Duguit calls "public responsibility." This is why the public service is a principle of social solidarity, one which is imposed on all, and not a principle of sovereignty, inasmuch as the latter is incompatible with the very idea of public responsibility. This conception of the public service has largely been suppressed by the fiction of state sovereignty. But the public service nonetheless continues to make itself felt by virtue of the strong connection citizens feel toward what they still consider to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fundamental_right" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:fundamental right">fundamental right</a>. For the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights" class="extiw" title="w:Civil and political rights">citizen's right</a> to public services is the strict corollary of the duty or obligation of state representatives to provide public services. This why the citizens of various European countries affected by the current crisis have demonstrated, in diverse ways, their attachment to public services in their daily fight against the coronavirus: for instance, the citizens of numerous Spanish cities <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clap_for_Our_Carers" class="extiw" title="w:Clap for Our Carers">have applauded</a> their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_healthcare_workers" class="extiw" title="w:Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers">healthcare workers</a> from their balconies, regardless of their political attitude toward the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralized_government" class="extiw" title="w:Centralized government">centralized</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unitary_state" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:unitary state">unitary state</a>. [...] Two relations must therefore be carefully separated here: the citizenry’s attachment to the public service, and <a href="/wiki/Healthcare" class="mw-redirect" title="Healthcare">healthcare</a> in particular, in no way suggests adherence to public <a href="/wiki/Authority" title="Authority">authority</a> or public power in its various forms, but rather suggests an attachment to services whose essential function is to meet the public's need. Far from disclosing an underlying identification with the nation, this attachment gestures toward a sense of a universal that crosses borders, and accordingly renders us sensitive to the trials our "pandemic co-citizens" are enduring, whether they are Italian, Spanish, or live beyond European borders. We are extremely <a href="/wiki/Skeptical" class="mw-redirect" title="Skeptical">skeptical</a> of Macron's promise to be the first leader to question "our developmental model" after the crisis is over, and there are plenty of reasons to think that the drastic economic measures currently in place will eventually share the same fate as those enacted during the <a href="/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008" class="mw-redirect" title="Financial crisis of 2007–2008">2008 economic crisis</a>: we will likely see a concerted effort to "<a href="/wiki/Status_quo" title="Status quo">return to normal</a>" — i.e., return to our otherwise uninterrupted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment" class="extiw" title="w:Human impact on the environment">destruction of the planet</a> amidst increasingly conditions of <a href="/wiki/Social_inequality" title="Social inequality">social inequality</a>.

<ul><li>Are 30,000 to 40,000 deaths a year too many? That’s generally what the country sees with gun violence and car crashes — and American policymakers, at least, haven’t been driven to major actions on these fronts. <br /> Are as many as 60,000 deaths a year too many? That’s what Americans have tolerated for the flu. <br /> Are 90,000 deaths a year too many? That’s the death toll of the ongoing drug overdose crisis — and while policymakers have taken some steps to combat that, experts argue the actions so far have fallen short, and the issue doesn’t draw that much national attention. <br /> Is the current death toll — of more than 1,500 a day, or equivalent to more than 500,000 deaths a year — too much? Many people would say, of course, it is. But in the middle of a delta variant surge, Americans may be revealing their preferences as restaurant reservations are now around the pre-pandemic normal — a sign the country is moving on.

<ul><li>The Covid-19 pandemic has jolted everyone into a renewed interest in environmentalism, sustainability, and conservation. In fact, nature is celebrating in the wake of the pandemic. Animals have been found roaming the streets of numerous cities around the world because humans have temporarily retreated. Fish are being seen in rivers previously too polluted to support life, and the skies have cleared up of pollution. It is unfortunate that humanity needed this hard knock to give back nature its share, at least in the short term. But this wakeup call could also be an opportunity to bring spirituality back into people’s lives in a big way.

<ul><li>During the pandemic, many of us have begun to discover how much of our travel is unnecessary. Governments can build on this to create plans for reducing the need to move, while investing in walking, cycling and – when physical distancing is less necessary – <a href="/wiki/Public_transport" title="Public transport">public transport</a>. This means wider pavements, better cycle lanes, buses run for service not profit. They should invest heavily in <a href="/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">green energy</a>, and even more heavily in reducing energy demand – through, for example, home insulation and better heating and lighting. The pandemic exposes the need for better neighbourhood design, with less public space given to cars and more to people. It also shows how badly we need the kind of security that a lightly taxed, deregulated economy cannot deliver.

<ul><li>Even among the experts I’ve spoken to over the past few weeks, there’s wide disagreement on how much risk is tolerable, when milder precautions like masking are warranted, and at what point harsher measures, like lockdowns and school closures, are needed. There’s not even agreement on what the endgame is; some say that, from a policy standpoint, the goal should be to keep caseloads manageable for hospitals, while others call for doing much more to drive down Covid-19. <br /> One big problem identified by experts: “I don’t think we’re having those conversations enough,” Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease epidemiologist at George Mason University, told me. Instead of the public and officials openly discussing how much risk is acceptable, the public dialogue often feels like two extremes — the very risk-averse and those downplaying any risk of the coronavirus whatsoever — talking past each other.
<ul><li>Saskia Popescu as quoted by German Lopez in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22651046/covid-19-delta-vaccines-social-distancing-masking-lockdowns">“America needs to decide how much Covid-19 risk it will tolerate”</a>, <i>Vox</i>, (Sep 7, 2021)</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>If I had to sum it up, I would say sheer madness. It's obscene. It's strictly political, really, an attempt to divert from what we all know has been a gross mismanagement of the prevention phase of this in the United States and the response phase, and it's tragic because the <a href="/wiki/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> now is moving into a phase where it is going to try to help avert a catastrophe in the developing world. If we think about how difficult it has been for us in the United States with our sophisticated healthcare system to manage this crisis, imagine living in a slum in a developing country or in a refugee camp. And in places like that, the only place you really have to turn for expertise and for financial support is the World Health Organization when governments themselves can't provide the resources. So the timing of this is particularly catastrophic because it is just about to wallop parts of the world in vulnerable communities that really can't handle it. I mean, Trump has a point about aspects of the World Health Organization's response that have been problematic. The problem is his very criticisms are ones that you could levy just as easily at him, overreliance on China, flattery of China, sucking up to China, to put it in an undiplomatic way. I mean, that's something that we saw it characterize the early phase of the U.S. response led by President Trump, and downplaying the crisis until it was too late, missing the month of February, as he did, to get the testing apparatuses in place and put in place the kinds of guidelines that we have now but at the time when it's already spread across the country.

<ul><li>The pandemic-related economic slowdown temporarily reduced the carbon dioxide emissions that cause global warming. But over the coming decade fossil fuel use needs to decline precipitously if the worst effects of climate change are to be avoided. Instead, fossil fuel development and production are projected to increase. Atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations hit a record high in 2020, one of the two warmest years on record. The massive wildfires and tropical cyclones of 2020 are illustrations of the major devastation that will only increase if governments do not significantly and quickly amplify their efforts to bring greenhouse gas emissions essentially to zero.

<ul><li>Covid is a virus that is highly transmissible with a low fatality rate. For a variety of reasons (legit and opportunistic), state governments invoked a variety of powers to combat the virus. It’s spread person to person. Due to fears of asymptomatic spread, no one could be sure who was infected. It was most dangerous for transmission in large, group settings.

<ul><li>In an interview with The Economist last month, Bill Gates stated that millions of people in developing countries would die before the COVID-19 pandemic was over. He noted, importantly, that 90 percent of the deaths would not result from the virus itself, but from “indirect” effects. These include most prominently the economic impact of the pandemic, as well as other causes such as the overwhelming of medical and public health resources, which increases fatalities from other diseases.  Gates was not exaggerating at all. It’s easy to see how this horror will materialize, if we project forward from the current situation.

<ul><li>The World Food Program projects that the number of people facing acute hunger will nearly double this year, from 135 to 260 million. This is mainly a result of the economic impact of the pandemic: as the World Bank has noted, this is the worst global recession since the end of World War II, and the worst ever (since 1870) in terms of the number of countries pushed into recession. It creates poverty, extreme poverty and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people in developing countries.

You’re putting everyone around you in danger by possibly exposing them to <a href="/wiki/COVID-19" class="mw-redirect" title="COVID-19">COVID-19</a>, ultimately leading to severe illness and even death for some....You’ll never even know that you injured someone or gave them the virus that caused their death.....I’ve heard some say, “It’s <a href="/wiki/My_body,_my_choice" class="mw-redirect" title="My body, my choice">My body, my choice</a>.” It’s your choice for your body, but not my body, or all the general public’s bodies around you that you are exposing to the virus...."</dd></dl>
