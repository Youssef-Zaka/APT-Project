<p><strong>SECTION 2. USE OF THE SERVICES</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1</strong> Login Management. Access to and use of certain Services is restricted, such as to the specified number of individual Agents permitted under Your subscription to the applicable Service, as detailed in Our Documentation. For Services that are Agent-based, You agree and acknowledge that an Agent Login cannot be shared or used by more than one (1) individual per Account. However, Agent Logins may be reassigned to new individuals replacing former individuals who no longer require ongoing use of the Services. You and Your Agents are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of all Agent Login information for Your Account. Absent a written license from Zendesk expressly stating otherwise, You agree and acknowledge that You may not use the Services, including but not limited to the API, to circumvent the requirement for an individual Agent Login for each individual who (a) leverages the Services to interact with End-Users; (b) Processes data related to interactions with End-Users; or (c) Processes data related to interactions originating from a Non-Zendesk Service that provides functionality similar to functionality provided by the Services and which would, pursuant to this Agreement, require an individual Agent Login, if utilizing the Services for such interaction. Further, Subscriber shall not use the API or any Software in such a way to circumvent applicable Service Plan restrictions or Agent licensing restrictions that are enforced in the Service user interface. Should Zendesk discover that Your use of a Service violates this Agreement or the Service Plan features and limitations on Our Site or Documentation, Zendesk reserves the right to charge You, and You hereby agree to pay, for said overuse, in addition to other remedies available to Us.</p>
<p><strong>2.2</strong> Compliance. As between You and Zendesk, You are responsible for compliance with the provisions of this Agreement by Agents and End-Users and for any and all activities that occur under Your Account, which Zendesk may verify from time to time. Without limiting the foregoing, You will ensure that Your use of the Services is compliant with all applicable laws and regulations as well as any and all privacy policies, agreements or other obligations You may maintain or enter into with Agents or End-Users.</p>
<p><strong>2.3</strong> Content and Conduct. In addition to complying with the other terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in this Agreement, You agree to the Zendesk User Content and Conduct Policy which is hereby incorporated into this Agreement. Further, in Your use of the Services You agree not to (a) modify, adapt, or hack the Services or otherwise attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services or related systems or networks; (b) attempt to bypass or break any security or rate limiting mechanism on any of the Services or use the Services in any manner that interferes with or disrupts the integrity, security or performance of the Services and its components; (c) attempt to decipher, decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise discover the source code of any Software making up the Services; or (d) to the extent You are subject to the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and its implementing regulations (HIPAA), use the Services to store or transmit any &#8220;protected health information&#8221; as defined by HIPAA, unless expressly agreed to otherwise in writing by Zendesk.</p>
<p><strong>2.4</strong> System Requirements. A high-speed Internet connection is required for proper transmission of the Services. You are responsible for procuring and maintaining the network connections that connect Your network to the Services including, but not limited to, browser software that supports protocols used by Zendesk, including the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol or other protocols accepted by Zendesk, and to follow procedures for accessing services that support such protocols. We are not responsible for notifying You, Agents or End-Users of any upgrades, fixes or enhancements to any such software or for any compromise of data, including Service Data, transmitted across computer networks or telecommunications facilities (including but not limited to the Internet) which are not owned, operated or controlled by Zendesk. We assume no responsibility for the reliability or performance of any connections as described in this Section.</p>
<p><strong>2.5</strong> Internal Business Purposes Only. Unless otherwise authorized by Zendesk in this Agreement or expressly agreed to otherwise in writing by Zendesk, You may not use the Services in any manner where You act as a service bureau or to provide any outsourced business process services on behalf of more than one (1) third party (other than Affiliates) through a single Account. This provision is not intended to prevent or inhibit the use of the Services to provide business support to multiple End-Users; however, You agree not to license, sublicense, sell, outsource, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, time-share or otherwise commercially exploit or resell the Services to any third party, other than authorized Agents and End-Users in furtherance of Your internal business purposes as expressly permitted by this Agreement, unless expressly agreed to otherwise in writing by Zendesk. Without limiting the foregoing, Your right to access and use the API is also subject to the restrictions and policies implemented by Zendesk from time to time with respect to the API as set forth in the Documentation or otherwise communicated to You in accordance with this Agreement.</p>

<div class="legal-info-section" id="term-cancellation-termination">
<p><strong>SECTION 3. TERM, CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.1</strong> Term. Unless Your Account and subscription to a Service are terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or unless otherwise provided for in an Order Form (a) Your subscription to a Service (including any and all Deployed Associated Services) will renew for a Subscription Term equivalent in length to the then expiring Subscription Term and (b) the Subscription Charges applicable to any subsequent Subscription Term shall be Our standard Subscription Charges for the applicable Service Plan and Deployed Associated Services at the time such subsequent Subscription Term commences.</p>
<p><strong>3.2</strong> Cancellation. Either Party may elect to terminate Your Account and subscription to a Service as of the end of Your then-current Subscription Term by providing notice, in accordance with Section 20 of this Agreement, no less than thirty (30) days prior to the end of such Subscription Term. </p>
<p><strong>3.3</strong> Mutual Termination for Cause. A Party may terminate this Agreement for cause (a) upon written notice to the other Party of a material breach by the other Party if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date of the breaching Party’s receipt of such written notice; or (b) if the other Party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors. However, We may immediately terminate this Agreement for cause and without advance notice if You violate the Zendesk User Content and Conduct Policy.</p>
<p>We will refund You any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the Subscription Term as of the effective date of termination if this Agreement is terminated by You in accordance with this Section for Zendesk’s uncured material breach.</p>
<p>You are required to pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the Subscription Term pursuant to all applicable Order Forms if this Agreement is terminated by Us for Your material breach in accordance with this Section. In no event will Our termination for cause relieve You of Your obligation to pay any fees payable to Us for the period prior to the effective date of termination.</p>
<p><strong>3.4</strong> Payment Upon Termination. Except for Your termination under Section 3.3 for Our uncured material breach, if You terminate Your subscription to a Service or cancel Your Account prior to the end of Your then effective Subscription Term, or if We terminate or cancel Your Account pursuant to Section 3.3, in addition to any other amounts You may owe Zendesk, You must immediately pay any and all unpaid Subscription Charges associated with the remainder of such Subscription Term. </p>
<p><strong>3.5</strong> No Refunds. Except for Your termination rights under Section 3.3, if You elect to terminate Your subscription to a Service or cancel Your Account prior to the end of Your then current Subscription Term, no refunds or credits for Subscription Charges or other fees or payments will be provided to You.</p>
<p><strong>3.6</strong> Export of Service Data. Upon Your written request, We will make Service Data available to You for export or download as provided in the Documentation for thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination, expiration or migration of Your Account, unless We have suspended or terminated Your Account due to Your breach of the Agreement, in which case Your Service Data will be available for download until We notify You of such suspension or termination. Thereafter, We will have no obligation to maintain or provide any Service Data, and, as provided in the Documentation, We will, unless prohibited by law or legal order, delete Your Service Data in Our Services in accordance with Our Service Data Deletion Policy available on Zendesk’s Agreement and Terms Website.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="legal-info-section" id="billing-plan-modification-payments">
<p><strong>SECTION 4. BILLING, PLAN MODIFICATIONS AND PAYMENTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.1</strong> Payment and Billing. All Subscription Charges are due in full upon commencement of Your Subscription Term, or with respect to a Deployed Associated Service, at the time such Deployed Associated Service is purchased, subscribed to or otherwise deployed, unless otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, an Order Form, a Statement of Work, or in Supplemental Terms, or as otherwise agreed for Usage Charges. You are responsible for providing valid and current payment information and You agree to promptly update your Account information, including payment information, with any changes that may occur (for example, a change in Your billing address or credit card expiration date). If You fail to pay Your Subscription Charges or any other charges indicated on any Order Form or Statement of Work, or in any Supplemental Terms, within five (5) business days of Our notice to You that payment is delinquent, or if You do not update payment information upon Our request, in addition to Our other remedies, We may suspend or terminate access to and use of the Services by You, Agents and End-Users.</p>
<p><strong>4.2</strong> Upgrades. If You choose to upgrade Your Service Plan or increase the number of Agents authorized to access and use a Service during Your Subscription Term, any incremental Subscription Charges associated with such upgrade will be charged in accordance with the remaining Subscription Term. In any future Subscription Term, Your Subscription Charges will reflect any such upgrades.</p>
<p><strong>4.3</strong> Downgrades. You may not downgrade Your Service Plan or reduce the number of Agents during any Subscription Term. If You desire to downgrade Your Service Plan or reduce the number of Agents under any Service Plan for a subsequent Subscription Term, You must provide Zendesk with thirty (30) days written notice prior to the end of Your then current Subscription Term. You must demote any downgraded Agents prior to the beginning of the subsequent Subscription Term. Downgrading Your Service Plan may cause loss of content, features, or capacity of the Service as available to You under Your Account, and Zendesk does not accept any liability for such loss.</p>
<p><strong>4.4</strong> Taxes. Unless otherwise stated, Our charges do not include any Taxes. You are responsible for paying Taxes assessed in connection with Your subscription to the Services except those assessable against the Zendesk Group measured by its net income. We will invoice You for such Taxes if We believe We have a legal obligation to do so and You agree to pay such Taxes if so invoiced.</p>
<p><strong>4.5</strong> Payment Agent. If You pay by credit card or certain other payment instruments, the Services provide an interface for the Account owner to change credit card information (e.g., upon card renewal). Payments made by credit card, debit card or certain other payment instruments for the Zendesk Service are billed and processed by Zendesk’s Payment Agent. You hereby authorize the Payment Agent to bill Your credit card or other payment instrument in advance on a periodic basis in accordance with the terms of the Service Plan for the Services, and for periodic Subscription Charges applicable to Deployed Associated Services to which You subscribe until Your subscription to the Services terminates, and You further agree to pay any Subscription Charges so incurred. If applicable, You hereby authorize Zendesk and the Payment Agent to charge Your credit card or other payment instrument to establish prepaid credit. The Account owner will receive a receipt upon each acceptance of payment by the Payment Agent, or they may obtain a receipt from within the Services to track subscription status. To the extent the Payment Agent is not Zendesk, the Payment Agent is acting solely as a billing and processing agent for and on behalf of Zendesk and shall not be construed to be providing the applicable Service. The Payment Agent uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing and this intermediary is not permitted to store, retain or use Your billing information except to process Your credit card information for the Payment Agent.</p>
<p><strong>4.6</strong> Payment Portals. If You mandate Zendesk use a vendor payment portal or compliance portal that charges Zendesk a subscription fee or a percentage of any uploaded invoice as a required cost of doing business, You shall be invoiced by Zendesk for, and You are obligated to pay, the cost of this fee.</p>
<p><strong>4.7</strong> Promotional Credits. Any promotional credits issued hereunder will be subject to the Zendesk Promotional Credits Policy available on the Zendesk Agreements and Terms Website.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="legal-info-section" id="confidential-information">
<p><strong>SECTION 5. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Each Party will protect the other’s Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access or disclosure in the same manner as each Party protects its own Confidential Information, but with no less than reasonable care. Except as otherwise expressly permitted pursuant to this Agreement, each Party may use the other Party’s Confidential Information solely to exercise its respective rights and perform its respective obligations under this Agreement and shall disclose such Confidential Information (a) solely to the employees and/or non-employee service providers and contractors who have a need to know such Confidential Information and who are bound by terms of confidentiality intended to prevent the misuse of such Confidential Information; (b) as necessary to comply with an order or subpoena of any administrative agency or court of competent jurisdiction; or (c) as reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law or regulation. Except for Zendesk’s Security Non-Disclosure Agreement (where executed by You), the provisions of this Section 5 shall control over any non-disclosure agreement by and between the Parties and any such non-disclosure agreement shall have no further force or effect with respect to the exchange of Confidential Information after the execution of this Agreement. To be clear, any exchange of Confidential Information prior to the execution of this Agreement shall continue to be governed by any such non-disclosure agreement.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="legal-info-section" id="ownership-security-service-data">
<p><strong>SECTION 6. OWNERSHIP AND SECURITY OF SERVICE DATA</strong></p>
<p><strong>6.1</strong> Ownership of Service Data. Subscriber shall retain ownership rights to all Service Data Processed under the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>6.2</strong> No Sale of Service Data. Zendesk will never sell, rent, or lease Your Service Data to any third party. We will not share Your Service Data with third parties, except as permitted by this Agreement and in order to provide, secure, and improve the Services.</p>
<p><strong>6.3</strong> Safeguards.

The names and locations of all current Sub-processors used for the Processing of Personal Data within Service Data under this Agreement are set forth in the Sub-processor Policy available on Zendesk’s Agreements and Terms Website.</p>
