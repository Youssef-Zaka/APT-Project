<h2 class="h3" id="introductions">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>This Policy details our commitment to protecting the privacy of individuals who:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li type="a">visit our Websites (defined below) (“Website Visitors”) or individuals who request us to contact them via our online web forms;</li>
<li type="a">who register to use the products and services which we market for subscription available at www.zendesk.com (the “Service(s)”); or</li>
<li type="a">attend or register to attend webinars, sponsored events or other events at which the Zendesk Group participates (“Attendees”).</li>
</ol>
<p>For the purposes of this Policy, the term “Websites” shall refer collectively to <a href="/">www.zendesk.com</a> as well as the other websites that the Zendesk Group operates and that link to this Policy. This Policy describes how the Zendesk Group collects, uses, shares and secures the personal data that you provide. It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal data.</p>
<h2 class="h3" id="scope-of-this-policy">2. Scope Of This Policy</h2>
<p>    <em>When this Policy applies:</em></p>
<p> In addition to the Websites that link to this Policy, this Policy applies to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
        The <a href="/apps/">Zendesk Marketplace</a>, which is an online marketplace for on-demand web applications utilized in conjunction with some of the Services. The Zendesk Group and third parties may post applications to the Zendesk Marketplace. When we post an application and the application links to this Policy, this Policy applies. When a third party posts an application, the privacy policy of the third party applies.
      </li>
<li>
        The <a href="https://developer.zendesk.com/">Zendesk Developer Portal</a>, which enables Subscribers to create web applications and other integrations with our Services. For the purposes of this Policy, the term “Subscriber” means an individual or an entity that has entered into a Service Agreement (defined below) for use of our Services.
      </li>
</ul>
<p><em>When this Policy does not apply &#8211; Third party websites:</em></p>
<p>Our Websites may contain links to other websites.  The information practices and the content of such other websites are governed by the privacy statements of such other websites. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any such other websites to understand their information practices.</p>
<p><em>When this Policy does not apply &#8211; Service Data:</em></p>
<p>        With the exception of Account Information (as defined below) and other information we collect in connection with your registration or authentication into our Services, this Policy does not apply to our security and privacy practices in connection with electronic data, text, messages, communications or other materials submitted to and stored within the Services by you (“Service Data”). Service Data security and privacy practices are detailed in and governed by our Master Subscription Agreement, available <a href="/company/customers-partners/master-subscription-agreement/?cta=msa">here</a>, or such other applicable agreement between you and any member of the Zendesk Group relating to your access to and your use of such Services (collectively referred to as the “Service Agreement”).</p>
<p>Subscribers to our Services are solely responsible for establishing policies for, and ensuring compliance with, all applicable laws and regulations, as well as any and all privacy policies, agreements or other obligations, relating to the collection of personal data in connection with the use of our Services by individuals (also referred to as “data subjects”) with whom our Subscribers interact.</p>
<p>We collect information under the direction of our Subscribers, and have no direct relationship with individuals whose personal data we process in connection with our Subscriber’s use of our Services. The use of information collected through our Services shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which Subscribers have engaged a member of the Zendesk Group. If you are an individual who interacts with a Subscriber using our Services (such as a customer or user of one of our Subscribers) and require assistance or would either like to amend your contact information or no longer wish to be contacted by one of our Subscribers that use our Services, please contact the Subscriber that you interact with directly.</p>
<h2 class="h3" id="information-that-you-provide-to-us">3. Information That You Provide To Us</h2>
<p><em>Account and Registration Information:</em></p>
<p>We ask for and may collect personal data about you such as your name, address, phone number, email address, instant messaging ID, and credit card information, as well as certain related information like your company name and website name, when you register for an account to access or utilize one or more of our Services (an “Account”). We also ask for and collect personal data such as an email address and a name or alias from any individual that you authorize to log into and utilize our Services in connection with Your Account (an “Agent” or “End-User” as defined in the Service Agreement). We base the processing of your personal data on our legitimate interest, to provide you with the necessary functionality during your use of our Service(s).</p>
<p>If you sign-up for a free trial Account, you are not required to enter your credit card information unless and until you decide to continue with a paid subscription to our Services. A third-party intermediary is used to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information for any purpose except for credit card processing on our behalf. </p>
<p>We refer to any information described above as “Account Information” for the purposes of this Policy. By voluntarily providing us with Account Information, you represent that you are the owner of such personal data or otherwise have the requisite consent to provide it to us.</p>
<p><em>Other Submissions:</em></p>
<p>We ask for and may collect personal data from you when you submit web forms on our Websites or as you use interactive features of the Websites, including: participation in webinars, surveys, contests, promotions, sweepstakes, requesting customer support, or otherwise communicating with us. We process your personal data to perform our contract with you for the use of our websites and the Service(s) and to fulfill our obligations under the Service Agreement to you; where we have not entered into the Service Agreement with you, we base the processing of your personal data on our legitimate interest to operate and administer our websites and to provide you with the content you access and request.</p>
<p><em>Attendee Information:</em></p>
<p>We ask for and may collect personal data such as your name, address, phone number and email address when you register for or attend a sponsored event or other events at which any member of the Zendesk Group participates, in order to facilitate your registration or attendance at an event, including sending related communications to you.</p>
<p><em>Mobile Application:</em></p>
<p>When you or your Agents download and use our Services, we automatically collect information such as the type of device you use, the operating system version of the device, the cellular carrier facilitating connection to the mobile application, and the country the connection is arising from, to perform our obligations under our Master Subscription Agreement with our Subscribers.</p>
<h2 class="h3" id="information-that-we-collect-from-you-on-our-websites">4. Information That We Collect From You on our Websites</h2>
<p><em>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:</em></p>
<p>We and our authorized partners may use cookies and other information gathering technologies for a variety of purposes. These technologies may provide us with personal data, information about devices and networks you utilize to access our Websites, and other information regarding your interactions with our Websites. For detailed information about the use of cookies on our Websites and how to manage your cookie settings, please read and review our Cookie Policy found <a href="/company/agreements-and-terms/cookie-policy/?cta=cookie">here</a>.</p>
<p>We may use web beacons, tags and scripts on our Websites or in email or other electronic communications we send to you. These assist us in delivering cookies, counting visits to our Websites, understanding usage and campaign effectiveness and determining whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by our third-party service providers on an individual and aggregated basis. </p>
<p>We use Local Storage such as HTML5 and Local Shared Objects (“LSOs,” also known as Flash cookies) to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Websites or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use HTML5 and Flash to collect and store information. For further information on how to manage Flash cookies, please click <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>We partner with third parties to either display advertising on the Websites or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may also use technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tags, flash, HTML5, scripts, or other tracking technologies to gather information about your activities on our Websites and other sites in order to suggest advertisements based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info">here</a> and <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org">here</a> (or if located in the European Union you may opt into the use of cookies, by clicking <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">here</a>). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads and you will continue to receive generic, untargeted ads.</p>
<p><em>Logs:</em></p>
<p>As is true with most websites and services delivered over the Internet, we gather certain information and store it in log files when you interact with our Websites and Services. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses as well as browser type, internet service provider, URLs of referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, information you search for, locale and language preferences, identification numbers associated with your devices, your mobile carrier, and system configuration information. Occasionally, we connect personal data to information gathered in our log files as necessary to improve our Websites and Services. In such a case, we would treat the combined information in accordance with this Policy.</p>
<p><em>Analytics:</em></p>
<p>We collect analytics information when you use the Websites to help us improve them, including through the use of cookies. We may also share aggregated and/or anonymized data about your actions on our Websites with third-party service providers of analytics services. We also use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile versions of our Services on your mobile device. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.</p>
<h2 class="h3" id="information-collected-from-other-sources">5. Information Collected From Other Sources</h2>
<p><em>Social Media Widgets:</em></p>
<p>The Websites include social media features, such as the &#8220;Facebook Like&#8221; button, and widgets, such as the &#8220;Share This&#8221; button or interactive mini-programs that run on our Websites. These features may collect your Internet protocol address, which page you are visiting on the Websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Websites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy statement of the companies that provide them.</p>
<p><em>Information From Services Provided by Third Parties:</em></p>
<p>We may also obtain other information, including personal data, from third parties and combine that with information we collect through our Websites. For example, we may have access to certain information from a third party social media or authentication service if you log into our Services through such a service or otherwise provide us with access to information from the service. Any access that we may have to such information from a third party social media or authentication service is in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by that service. If you authorize us to connect with a third party service, we will access and store your name, email address(es), current city, profile picture URL, and any other personal data that the third party service makes available to us, and use and disclose it in accordance with this Policy. You should check your privacy settings on these third party services to understand and change the information sent to us through these services. For example, you may choose to log in to the Services using single sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider.</p>
<p>These single sign-on services will authenticate your identity, provide you with the option to share certain personal data (such as your name and email address) with us, and pre-populate our sign-up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities in the Services to your profile page to share with others within your network.</p>
<h2 class="h3" id="how-we-use-information-that-we-collect">6.  How We Use Information That We Collect</h2>
<p><em>General Uses: </em></p>

<p><em>Legal basis for processing (EEA visitors only):</em></p>
<p>If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area (“EEA”), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data described above will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>
<p>However, we will normally collect personal data from you only where we need the personal data to perform a contract with you (e.g. to provide you with our Services), where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms, or where we have your consent. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal data from you.</p>
<p>If we ask you to provide personal data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal data)</p>
<p>Similarly, if we collect and use your personal data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time why we need to use your personal data. If we process personal data in reliance on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
<p>If you have questions about, or need further information concerning, the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal data, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “Contact Us” section below.</p>
<h2 class="h3" id="sharing-of-information-collected">7.  Sharing Of Information Collected</h2>
<p><em>Third-Party Service Providers:</em></p>
<p>We share information, including personal data, with our third-party service providers that we use to provide hosting for and maintenance of our Websites, application development, backup, storage, payment processing, analytics and other services for us. These third-party service providers may have access to or process your personal data for the purpose of providing these services for us. We do not permit our third-party service providers to use the personal data that we share with them for their marketing purposes or for any other purpose than in connection with the services they provide to us.
</p>
<p>We may also share aggregated and/or anonymized information regarding your use of the Services with third parties for marketing purposes based on our legitimate interest to develop and promote Service(s). However, we would never identify you, your Agents or End-Users as the source of the information.</p>
<p>We may collect, and we may engage third-party analytics providers to collect, metrics and information regarding your use of the Service, including evaluating how Agents and End-Users use the Service (“Usage Data”), to develop new features, improve existing features or inform sales and marketing strategies, based on our legitimate interest to improve the Services. When we process Usage Data, any personal data shall be anonymized. Any such third-party analytics providers will not share or otherwise disclose Usage Data, although we may make Usage Data publicly available from time to time.</p>
<p><em>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of Our Rights:</em></p>
<p>In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may disclose personal data to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Service Agreement, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
<p><em>Testimonials:</em></p>
<p>From time to time, we may post testimonials on the Websites that may contain personal data. We always obtain your consent to post your name along with your testimonial. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@zendesk.com">privacy@zendesk.com</a>.</p>
<p><em>Referrals:</em></p>
<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our products and services, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. You must only provide your friend’s name and email address if you have a reasonable belief they will not object to us contacting them. If you do, we will automatically send your friend an email inviting him or her to visit the Websites and will store this information for the purpose of sending this initial email, tracking the success of our referral program and other marketing activities. Your referral may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@zendesk.com">privacy@zendesk.com</a> to request that we remove his/her information from our database.</p>
<p><em>Community Forums:</em></p>
<p>The Websites may offer publicly accessible blogs, community forums, comments sections, discussion forums, or other interactive features (“Interactive Areas”). You should be aware that any information that you post in an Interactive Area might be read, collected, and used by others who access it. To request removal of your personal data from an Interactive Area, contact us at privacy@zendesk.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal data, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
<p><em>Zendesk Group Sharing:</em></p>
<p>We may share information, including personal data, with any member of the Zendesk Group, and they will use that information only for the purposes already described in this Policy.</p>
<p><em>To Market our Services: </em></p>
<p>We may share information, including personal data, with our channel partners, solely for the purpose of enabling our channel partners to notify you about our Services. Zendesk requires its channel partners to provide an opt-out option within its communications to you. By opting out, you are opting out of receiving future communication from our channel partner.</p>
<p><em>With Your Consent:</em></p>
<p>We may also share personal data with third parties when we have your consent to do so.</p>
<h2 class="h3" id="international-transfer-of-personal-data">8. International Transfer of Personal Data<br />
</h2>
<p>We do not share your personal data with third parties, unless it is necessary to carry out your request, for our professional or legitimate business needs, or as required or permitted by law. Where we do transfer your personal data to third parties or service providers, appropriate arrangements will be made in order to ensure correct and secure data processing in compliance with applicable data protection law.</p>
<p>We store personal data about Website Visitors and Subscribers within the EEA, the United States and in other countries and territories. To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access such personal data from around the world, including from other countries in which the Zendesk Group has operations. Therefore, your personal data may be processed outside of the EEA and in countries which are not subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission and which may not provide for the same level of data protection as the EEA.</p>
<p>In this event, we will ensure that the recipient of your personal data offers an adequate level of protection, for instance by entering into standard contractual clauses for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission (Art. 46 GDPR), or we will ask you for your prior consent to such international data transfers.</p>
<p>We have implemented safeguards to ensure an adequate level of data protection where your personal data is transferred to countries outside the EEA, such as:</p>
<p>(a) the recipient country has an adequacy decision from the European Commission;</p>
<p>(b) the European Commission&#8217;s Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of personal data;</p>
<p>(c) Zendesk has Binding Corporate Rules in place which guarantee an adequate level of data protection wherever your data is physically kept; or</p>
<p>(d) Zendesk participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework; however, we do not rely on the Privacy Shield as a lawful mechanism to transfer personal data from the EU, United Kingdom, or Switzerland. Where the recipient is located in the United States, it may be a certified participant of the EU-US Privacy Shield or Swiss Privacy Shield Framework.</p>
<p>You can obtain more details of the protection given to your personal data when it is transferred outside Europe (including a sample copy of the model contractual clauses) by contacting us using the details set out at Clause 15 below.</p>
<p><em>Binding Corporate Rules:</em> </p>
<p>We have adopted Binding Corporate Rules that have been authorised by the EU data protection authorities, and which enable us to transfer personal data lawfully from EEA member states to other Zendesk Group companies around the world. More information on (including a copy of) our Binding Corporate Rules is available <a href="/company/customers-partners/eu-data-protection/#corporate-rules">here</a>, and evidence of our Binding Corporate Rules approval is available on the European Commission’s website <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/other/pre-gdpr-bcrs-overview-list-0_en">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Privacy Shield Frameworks:</em> </p>
<p>Zendesk abides by and has certified adherence to the principles of the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce; however, we do not rely on the Privacy Shield as a lawful mechanism to transfer personal data from the EU, United Kingdom, or Switzerland. For more information on the Privacy Shield frameworks, and to view the scope of Zendesk’s certification, please visit <a href="//www.privacyshield.gov/list/">https://www.privacyshield.gov/list</a>. Under certain conditions, more fully described on the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint">Privacy Shield website</a>, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. For residual Privacy Shield disputes that cannot be resolved by the methods above, you may be able to invoke a binding arbitration process under certain conditions. To find out more about the Privacy Shield’s binding arbitration scheme, please see: <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction">https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction</a></p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission has investigation and enforcement authority over our compliance with the Privacy Shield.</p>
<p>If we have received your personal data under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfer it to a third party service provider for processing, we will remain responsible if they process your personal data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
<h2 class="h3" id="other-important-privacy-information">9. Other Important Privacy Information</h2>
<p><em>Notice to End-Users</em></p>
<p>Our Services are intended for use by enterprises. Where our Services are made available to you through a Subscriber of ours, that enterprise is the data controller of your personal data. Your data privacy questions and requests should initially be submitted to the Zendesk Subscriber in its capacity as your data controller. Zendesk is not responsible for our Subscribers’ privacy or security practices which may be different than this Policy.</p>
<p>Zendesk’s Subscribers are able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Services;</li>
<li>access and describe your personal data that you provided to them;</li>
<li>access and export  your personal data processed by them; and</li>
<li>amend your personal data, including your end-user profile.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Data retention</em></p>
<p>Where Zendesk is the data controller of personal data (for example, personal data relating to Website Visitors, Attendees and individuals who register to use our Services), then we retain the personal data we collect where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with our Services, to enable your participation in an event, and to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal data, we will either delete or aggregate it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<p>If your personal data is processed within a Subscriber’s Service Data, we will process the personal data for as long as we are instructed to do so by the relevant Subscriber that is the data controller of the Subscriber Service Data.</p>
<h2 class="h3" id="how-to-exercise-your-data-protection-rights">10. How to Exercise Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
<p>You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your personal data. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.</p>
<p><em>Correcting, updating and removing your information:</em></p>
<p>An individual who seeks to exercise their data protection rights in respect of personal data stored or processed by us on behalf of a Subscriber of ours within the Subscriber’s Service Data (including to seek access to, or to correct, amend, delete, port or restrict processing of such personal data) should direct his/her query to our Subscriber (the data controller). Upon receipt of a request from one of our Subscribers for us to remove the personal data, we will respond to their request within thirty (30) days. We will retain personal data that we process and store on behalf of our Subscribers for as long as needed to provide the Services to our Subscribers.
</p>
<p><em>Accessing and updating or deleting your information:</em></p>
<p>Our Services and related documentation on our <a href="/company/privacy-and-data-protection/">Privacy and Data Protection site</a> give Agents and End-Users the ability to access, update and delete certain personal data from within the Service. For example, you can access your Agent or End-User profile and make updates to your personal data. In cases where we act as the data controller of your personal data, we will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal data upon request. We will respond to such requests within a reasonable timeframe. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.</p>
<p><em>Deactivating your user profile: </em></p>
<p>If you no longer wish to use our Services, Zendesk’s Subscriber may be able to deactivate your End-User account. First, please contact Zendesk’s Subscriber with your request. If you are a Zendesk Subscriber and are unable to deactivate an End-User account through your administrator settings, <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026614173" target="_blank">contact Zendesk for support</a>. Please be aware that deactivating your account does not delete your information; your information remains visible to other Service users based on your past participation within the Services.  For more information on how to delete your information, visit our <a href="/company/privacy-and-data-protection/">Privacy and Data Protection site</a>.</p>
<p><em>Request that we stop using your information:</em></p>
<p>You may request that your personal data no longer be accessed, stored, used and otherwise processed where you believe that a Zendesk Subscriber or Zendesk do not have the appropriate rights to do so.

If you are a resident of California, we are required to disclose certain uses and disclosures in a certain format, as well as to inform you of certain rights you may have. Any capitalized terms used in this supplemental privacy policy shall have the same meaning as in the general privacy policy.</p>
