This is a list of [[cultural heritage]] sites that have been damaged or destroyed accidentally, deliberately, or by a [[natural disaster]], sorted by country.

Cultural heritage can be subdivided into two main types—tangible and [[intangible heritage]]. The former includes built heritage such as religious buildings, museums, monuments, archaeological sites, and movable heritage such as works of art and manuscripts. Intangible cultural heritage includes customs, music, fashion and other traditions within a particular culture.&lt;ref>{{cite web|title=What is meant by "cultural heritage"?|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/illicit-trafficking-of-cultural-property/unesco-database-of-national-cultural-heritage-laws/frequently-asked-questions/definition-of-the-cultural-heritage/|website=[[UNESCO]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316203151/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/illicit-trafficking-of-cultural-property/unesco-database-of-national-cultural-heritage-laws/frequently-asked-questions/definition-of-the-cultural-heritage/|archive-date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>{{cite web|last1=Stenning|first1=Stephen|title=Destroying cultural heritage: more than just material damage|url=https://www.britishcouncil.org/voices-magazine/destroying-cultural-heritage-more-just-material-damage|website=[[British Council]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924145358/http://www.britishcouncil.org/voices-magazine/destroying-cultural-heritage-more-just-material-damage|archive-date=24 September 2015|date=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref> This article mainly deals with the destruction of built heritage; the destruction of movable collectible heritage is dealt with in [[art destruction]], whilst the destruction of movable [[industrial heritage]] remains almost totally ignored.

Deliberate and systematic destruction of cultural heritage, such as [[Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL|that carried out by ISIL]] and other terrorist organizations, is regarded as a form of [[cultural genocide]].&lt;ref>{{cite news|last1=Porter|first1=Lizzie|title=Destruction of Middle East's heritage is 'cultural genocide'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/middle-east/articles/Destruction-of-Middle-Easts-heritage-is-cultural-genocide/|access-date=7 April 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>{{cite news|last1=Sehmer|first1=Alexander|title=Isis guilty of 'cultural cleansing' across Syria and Iraq, Unesco chief Irina Bokova says|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/unesco-chief-irina-bokova-accuses-islamist-groups-of-cultural-cleansing-isis-a6679761.html|access-date=7 April 2016|work=[[The Independent]]|date=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref>

* During the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|Soviet invasion]], large-scale looting occurred in various archaeological sites including [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], ancient site of [[Ai-Khanoum]], the [[Buddhist]] monastery complex in Tepe Shortor which dates back to the 2nd century AD, and the National Kabul Museum.

===Thailand===
In June 1932 in Siam—now Thailand—a [[Siamese revolution of 1932|revolution]] overthrew 700 years of absolute monarchy. A political structure based on a constitution that required non-royal governments elected by the people, was introduced. On 10 December 1936, the first post-revolution prime minister, [[Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena|Phraya Phahon]], held a small ceremony to embed a small plaque the size of a dinner plate into the ground at the spot, in front of Bangkok's [[Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall]], where he had first announced the end of the absolute monarchy.&lt;ref name=Nation-20200922>{{cite news |title=The history and significance of the Khana Ratsadon memorial plaque |url=https://www.nationthailand.com/opinion/30394936?utm_source=category&amp;utm_medium=internal_referral |access-date=12 March 2021 |work=The Nation |date=22 September 2020 |format=Opinion}}&lt;/ref> The inscription on it read: "Here on 24 June 1932 at dawn, the People's Party proclaimed a constitution for the country's advancement."&lt;ref name="BBC-20170420"/>

*During the [[Siege of Strasbourg]] that took place at the height of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870, the total destruction by [[Shell (projectile)|shelling]] and fire of the municipal library and the municipal art and archaeology collections resulted in the loss of 400,000 books,&lt;ref>{{cite web|title=La petite histoire d'une grande bibliothèque|url=http://www.mediatheques.strasbourg.eu/medias/medias.aspx?INSTANCE=exploitation&amp;PORTAL_ID=erm_portal_004.xml&amp;SYNCMENU=004|website=mediatheques.strasbourg.eu|access-date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref> 3,446&lt;ref>{{cite web|title=BNU Strasbourg - Histoire|url=http://www.bnu.fr/la-bnu/histoire|publisher=bnu.fr|access-date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref> [[Medieval]] [[manuscripts]], and thousands of [[incunable]]s, as well as of hundreds of paintings, [[stained glass windows]], and archaeological artefacts. The most famous lost object was the original manuscript of the [[Hortus deliciarum]].
*On 23 May 1871, the [[Tuileries Palace]], which had been the usual Parisian residence of French monarchs, was almost entirely gutted in a fire set by members of the [[Paris Commune]], leaving only the stone shell. It was subsequently demolished in 1883.
*In 1914, [[Reims Cathedral]] was burned as a result of shelling during the initial phase of the [[First World War]]. The cathedral was rebuilt after the war.
*The [[1978 Palace of Versailles bombing]] severely damaged parts of the [[Palace of Versailles]], including several priceless pieces of art. The palace was rebuilt and reopened to the public within four years.
*On 15 April 2019, the roof of the [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] [[Notre-Dame de Paris fire|caught fire]], severely damaging the [[bell tower]]s and resulting in the total collapse of the central [[spire]] and roof. The fire is believed to have been caused by the ongoing [[Building restoration|restoration]], though an investigation is ongoing.&lt;ref>{{cite news |last1=Busby |first1=Mattha |title=Notre Dame Cathedral: spire collapses in huge fire – live news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2019/apr/15/notre-dame-cathedral-fire-paris-france-landmark-live-news |access-date=15 April 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=15 April 2019}}&lt;/ref>

*Many historically and architecturally significant buildings were destroyed or severely damaged during [[World War II]] and the post-war period as a result of the Allied policy of [[area bombing]] of cities aimed at destroying or weakening infrastructure and war-related industry in the German Reich, as well as demoralizing the population by destroying urban cores and residential neighborhoods. Several hundred cities were destroyed, many of them by more than 80 percent. Striking examples are palaces like [[Berlin Palace]], [[Monbijou Palace]], and [[City Palace, Potsdam]], as well as churches like [[Dresden Frauenkirche]], [[Berlin Cathedral]], and [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]]. Several have been rebuilt since 1990 (including all those mentioned except Monbijou Palace and Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church).
*The [[Paulinerkirche, Leipzig|Paulinerkirche]] was a medieval church from 1231 in [[Leipzig]]. The church survived the war practically unscathed but was dynamited in 1968 during the communist regime of East Germany. After the reunification of Germany, a new building in a contemporary style, the Paulinum, was built on the site.
*The building housing the [[Historical Archive of the City of Cologne]] collapsed on 3 March 2009 during an underground railway line construction.
*The [[Church of St. Lambertus, Immerath|Church of St. Lambertus]] in [[Immerath (Erkelenz)|Immerath]] was demolished on 9 January 2018 as part of the demolition of the entire village to make way for an expansion of the [[Garzweiler surface mine]].

*The [[Colossus of Rhodes]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], was destroyed in the [[226 BC Rhodes earthquake]], and its remains were destroyed in the 7th century AD while Rhodes was under Arab rule. In December 2015, a group of European architects announced plans to build a modern Colossus where the original once stood.
*The [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]], also a Wonder of the Ancient World, was destroyed around the 5th century CE, although it is not known exactly when or how.
*The [[Parthenon]] was extensively damaged in 1687 during the [[Great Turkish War]] (1683–1699). The Ottoman army fortified the [[Acropolis of Athens]] and used the Parthenon as a gunpowder magazine and a shelter for members of the local Turkish community. On 26 September, a Venetian mortar round blew up the magazine, and the explosion blew out the building's central portion. About three hundred people were killed in the explosion, which caused fires that burned until the following day and consumed many homes.&lt;ref>{{Ιστορία του Ελληνικού Έθνους|volume=11 | last=Chasiotis | first=Ioannis | chapter = Η κάμψη της Οθωμανικής δυνάμεως |trans-chapter=The decline of Ottoman power | pages = 8–51 }}&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>{{cite book | last= Finlay | first= George | author-link= George Finlay | title= A History of Greece from its Conquest by the Romans to the Present Time, B.C. 146 to A.D. 1864, Vol. V: Greece under Othoman and Venetian Domination A.D. 1453 — 1821 | year= 1877 | publisher= Clarendon Press | location= Oxford | url = https://archive.org/details/ahistorygreecef05finlgoog }}&lt;/ref> The Parthenon was extensively and permanently damaged when Thomas Bruce, the 7th Earl of Elgin and ambassador to the Ottoman Empire (occupiers of Greece in the early 19th century), who admired the Parthenon's extensive collection of ancient marble sculptures, began extracting and expatriating them to Britain in 1801. More damage to the site's heritage came after independence, when all Medieval and Ottoman features of the Acropolis (most notably the [[Frankish Tower (Acropolis of Athens)|Frankish Tower]]) were destroyed by [[Heinrich Schliemann]] in a project to rid the site of all post-[[Classical Greece|Classical]] influence.

=== Hungary ===

*Numerous historical buildings in [[Budapest]] were damaged or destroyed during [[World War II]], including the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]], the [[Chain Bridge (Budapest)|Chain Bridge]], and the [[Sándor Palace, Budapest|Sándor Palace]]. These three have now been rebuilt.

=== Ireland ===
*During the [[Battle of Dublin]] at the beginning of the [[Irish Civil War]] in 1922, munitions were stored at the [[Four Courts]] building, which housed 1,000 years of Irish records in the Public Record Office. Under circumstances that are disputed, the munitions exploded, destroying much of [[Ireland]]'s historical record.
*The [[Irish Republican Army]] followed a policy of deliberate [[destruction of Irish country houses (1919–1923)]].

=== Italy ===

*Many historic gardens and villas were destroyed in Rome in the 19th century, including [[Villa Ludovisi]], [[Villa Negroni]] and [[Villa Astalli]];
*[[Tower of Paul III]] and Convent of Aracoeli, demolished to make room for the Victor Emmanuel Monument.
*Various historic buildings were demolished in the 19th and 20th centuries to make way for railways, industrial areas, or other modern buildings. Examples include the [[Castello di Villagonia]] and the [[Real Cittadella]] in [[Sicily]].
*Many historic buildings in Italy were destroyed or damaged during [[World War II]]. These include the monastery of [[Monte Cassino]], which was destroyed during the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]] but was rebuilt after the war.
*Several historic buildings, books, paintings, and sculptures were destroyed during the [[1966 flood of the Arno|Florence Flood of 1966]]. Also, [[Venice]] was affected during the [[1966 Venice flood|flood of 1966]].
*Several churches and other heritage sites were damaged or destroyed during earthquakes such as the [[1997 Umbria and Marche earthquake]], the [[2009 L'Aquila earthquake]], and the [[August 2016 Central Italy earthquake]].

*The [[Azure Window]], a {{convert|28|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall}} limestone natural arch on the island of Gozo in Malta. It was located in Dwejra Bay in the limits of San Lawrenz, close to the Inland Sea and the Fungus Rock. It was one of Malta's major tourist attractions. The arch, together with other natural features in the area of Dwejra, is featured in a number of international films and other media representations. The formation was anchored on the east end by the seaside cliff, arching over open water, to be anchored to a free standing pillar in the sea to the west of the cliff.

The operation resulted in the deportation of 496,000 [[Chechen people|Chechens]] and [[Ingush people|Ingush]] populations, and the death of around a quarter of them. It was also accompanied by the destruction of local cultural and societal heritages; names of these nations were erased from the books and records; placenames were replaced with Russian ones; mosques were demolished; villages were razed; and the historical [[Nakh language]] manuscripts were almost destroyed.

After extensive destruction of significant heritage buildings in the quakes and the loss of many community hubs within Christchurch the decision to demolish not only the Cathedral but also many other catholic churches (damaged and undamaged) was regarded by many in the city as an act of cultural vandalism.
