This means:

       <li>Where User is responsible for third-party use of their User Account due to noncompliance with said obligations, User shall be liable for all consequences, including payment for orders.</li> 
       <li>Springer Nature may suspend or terminate a User Account after a warning or immediately in order to prevent misuse.

     <li>By clicking the confirmation button, User submits their order. Springer Nature will send User a confirmation of receipt; subject to clause A.5.3 the contract is concluded upon such confirmation. The contract will not be filed and will not be accessible to User, but Springer Nature will include the Terms and Conditions in the confirmation email.</li> 
     <li>Should the payment process not be completed successfully, i.e. Springer Nature does not receive a confirmation of Customer’s payment from the relevant payment service provider, Springer Nature will not confirm the order, but notify Customer of the failure of payment, and no contract will be deemed made.</li>

<h3 id="guided-oa">1. <strong>Guided Open Access</strong> </h3> 
<p>Guided Open Access (“Guided OA”) is a programme that enables you to submit your Article to one Nature Research journal, and be considered simultaneously by two other associated journals in the Nature Portfolio. See our <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-research/open-access/guided-open-access">Guided OA page</a> for further details on the Guided OA programme.</p> 
<h4>a.Initial Submission</h4> 
<p>In order to participate in the Guided OA programme, you must select the Guided OA option when submitting your Article to a participating Nature Research Journal, and provide all information required pursuant to the submission process. If your Article is deemed appropriate for the Guided OA programme, it will be assigned to a handling editor from one of the participating journals, and you will be asked to arrange payment of an Editorial Assessment Charge (see Charges, below). If your Article is determined not to be suitable for any of the journals in the Guided OA programme, you will be notified and no Editorial Assessment Charge will be payable.</p> 
<h4>b.Editorial Assessment Report</h4> 
<p>Once your article has been assigned to a handling&nbsp; editor and you have provided billing details for the Editorial Assessment Charge, your Article will be sent for peer review in accordance with our standard practices. On the basis of their expert judgement, and the feedback from one round of peer review, the Nature Portfolio editor responsible for your Article will prepare an Editorial Assessment Report (EAR). The EAR will typically provide an editorial evaluation of the manuscript, an open research evaluation, guidance for adhering to best reproducibility practice, and help to navigate and interpret the reviewers’ feedback, but contents of individual EARs may vary. If your Article is provisionally recommended for publication after the first round of peer review, the EAR will recommend which journal(s) will be suitable for publication of your Article. If you choose to continue with a recommended journal, the peer review process will continue in accordance with the journal’s standard practice. However, you are under no obligation to continue with a recommended journal, and may use the EAR in connection with preparation for submission of your Article to another journal. <strong>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR PARTICIPATION IN GUIDED OA (1) DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOUR ARTICLE WILL BE PEER REVIEWED AT THE JOURNAL OF YOUR CHOICE, AND (2) DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE PUBLICATION OF YOUR ARTICLE IN ANY PARTICULAR PARTICIPATING JOURNAL, OR IN ANY OF THE PARTICIPATING JOURNALS.&nbsp; SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPTS WILL BE REVIEWED AND PUBLISHING DECISIONS MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HIGH STANDARDS OF NATURE PORTFOLIO JOURNALS. THE LIKELIHOOD OF ACCEPTANCE OF A MANUSCRIPT FOR PUBLICATION IN PARTICIPATING JOURNALS UNDER THE GUIDED OA PROGRAMME WILL BE NO GREATER THAN FOR MANUSCRIPTS SUBMITTED TO SUCH JOURNALS UNDER STANDARD SUBSCRIPTION OR OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING TERMS.</strong></p> 
<h4>&nbsp; c. Publication</h4> 
<p>Articles published through the Guided OA Programme will be published under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.</p> 
<h3 id="guided-oa-eligibility">2. <strong>Eligibility</strong> </h3> 
<p>If you are affiliated with an institution participating in a Fully OA agreement or Transformative (or Compact) agreement that includes Nature Portfolio journals, you will not be eligible for Guided Open Access, where fees are applied before acceptance (Editorial Assessment Charge). Direct Open Access is available to you by selecting the open access option once your paper has been accepted, with your fees covered by the relevant institutional agreement. Please check our <a href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/institutional-agreements">&nbsp;OA agreement pages</a> for further information about what fees are covered.</p> 
<h3 id="guided-oa-charges">3. <strong>Charges</strong> </h3> 
<p>Once your Article has entered the Guided Open Access process, you will be required to complete a Guided OA Editorial Assessment Charge (EAC) Payment Form, and arrange payment of the EAC. <strong>THE EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT CHARGE WILL NOT BE REFUNDED EVEN IF YOUR ARTICLE IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PUBLICATION IN ONE OF THE GUIDED OA JOURNALS PURSUANT TO THE EDITORIAL ASSESSMENT OR IS OTHERWISE NOT PUBLISHED IN A GUIDED OA JOURNAL FOR ANY REASON.</strong></p> 
<p>If your article is accepted for publication after completion of the peer review process at a recommended journal, you will be required to complete a Guided OA Top-Up Article Processing Charge (APC) Payment Form, and arrange payment of the Top-Up APC.</p> 
<p>If your Article is published in a Nature Research journal (Nature Physics,&nbsp;Nature Methods&nbsp;or&nbsp;Nature Genetics), the combined amount of the EAC and the Top-Up APC will be lower than the cost of publishing on an open access basis directly through those journals, outside of Guided OA. <strong>IF YOUR ARTICLE IS PUBLISHED IN NATURE COMMUNICATIONS OR ONE OF THE COMMUNICATIONS JOURNALS, THE COMBINED AMOUNT OF THE EAC AND THE TOP-UP APC WILL BE SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN THE COST OF PUBLISHING ON AN OPEN ACCESS BASIS DIRECTLY WITH ANY OF SUCH JOURNALS, OUTSIDE OF GUIDED OA.</strong> Please see the Nature Research <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-research/open-access/guided-open-access">Guided Open Access page</a> for exact costs.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3 id="guided-oa-row">4. <strong>Right of Withdrawal</strong> </h3> 
<p>You have the right to withdraw from your agreement to pay the EAC or Top-Up APC within 14 days without giving any reason.</p> 
<p>The withdrawal period will expire after 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract.</p> 
<p>To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us (for customers domiciled or established in North, Central or South America: Springer Nature Customer Service Center LLC, 200 Hudson Street, Suite 503, Jersey City, NJ 07311, USA, tel.: +44 (0)203 192 2009, email: <a href="mailto:ORSupport@springernature.com">ORSupport@springernature.com</a>; for customers domiciled or established in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, Oceania, Australia: Springer Nature Customer Service Center GmbH, Tiergartenstr. 15-17, 69121 Heidelberg, Germany, tel.: +44 (0)203 192 2009, email: <a href="mailto:ORSupport@springernature.com">ORSupport@springernature.com</a>) of your decision to withdraw from this contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g. a letter sent by post, fax or e-mail). You may use the attached model withdrawal form, but it is not obligatory.</p> 
<p>To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.</p> 
<h4>Effects of withdrawal</h4> 
<p>If you withdraw from the contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p> 
<p>If you requested to begin the performance of services during the withdrawal period, you shall pay us an amount which is in proportion to what has been provided until you have communicated us your withdrawal from this contract, in comparison with the full coverage of the contract.</p> 
<p>The following form may be used to state your withdrawal, but it is not obligatory:</p>
