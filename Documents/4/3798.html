<p>We will only use the personal data gathered over this website as set out in this policy. Below you will find information on how we use your personal data, for which purposes your personal data is used, with whom it is shared and what control and information rights you may have.</p> 
<h2>I. Summary of our processing activities</h2> 
<p>We publish scholarly journals, books, news and data. Some of this material is freely available; some of it is only available to subscribers. The following summary offers a quick overview of the data processing activities that are undertaken on our website. You will find more detailed information under the indicated sections below.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>When you visit our website for informational reasons without setting up an account, only limited personal&nbsp;data&nbsp;will be processed to provide you with the website itself (see III).</li> 
 <li>If you are identified as belonging to a customer organisation then we collect information in order to be able to&nbsp;provide usage reporting to that customer.</li> 
 <li>In case you register for one of our services, use the submission and peer review systems or subscribe to our newsletters, further personal data will be processed in the scope of such services (see IV and V).&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>Furthermore, your personal data will be used to provide you with relevant advertising for our services and products&nbsp;(see VII) and for statistical analysis that helps us to improve our website (see VIII). Additionally, we improve your website experience with third party content (see IX).</li> 
 <li>Your personal data may be disclosed to third parties (see X) that might be located outside your country of&nbsp;residence; potentially, different data protection standards may apply (see XI).</li> 
 <li>We have implemented appropriate safeguards to secure your personal data (see XII) and retain your personal data only as long as necessary (see XIII).</li> 
 <li>Under the legislation applicable to you, you may be entitled to exercise certain rights with regard to the processing&nbsp;of your personal data (see XIV).</li> 
</ul> 
<h2>II. Definitions</h2> 
<ul> 
 <li> <strong>Personal data</strong>: means any information relating to a natural person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, or an online identifier.</li> 
 <li> <strong>Processing</strong>: means any operation which is performed on personal data, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or any kind of disclosure or other use.</li> 
</ul> 
<h2>III. Informational use of the website</h2> 
<p>When you visit our website for informational reasons, i.e. without registering for any of our provided services listed under IV and without providing us with personal data in any other form, we may automatically collect additional information about you which will contain personal data only in limited cases and which is automatically recognised by our server, such as:</p> 
<p><em>Examples might include:</em></p> 
<p><em>- your IP address;<br> - your device type, name and IDs;<br> - the date and time of your requests;<br> - the content of your requests;<br> - information on your browser version;<br> - your screen resolution;<br> - information on your operating system, including language settings.</em></p> 
<p>We use such information only to assist us in providing an effective service (e.g. to adapt our website to the needs of your device or to allow you to log in to our website), and to collect broad demographic information for anonymised, aggregated use.</p> 
<p>If you are identified by IP or equivalent method as belonging to a customer organisation such as university or a company then we will also collect the identity of that organisation and use it to create usage reports which show the organisation how much of the content we publish is being read by their students, members or employees. This information does not contain anything related to a personal login unless (a) you are a nominated administrator for that organisation or (b) your organisation specifically requires it as a part of a usage-based access contract.</p> 
<p>The personal data automatically collected is necessary for us to provide the website, Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. b GDPR, and for our legitimate interest to guarantee the website’s stability and security, Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p> 
<h2>IV. Registration for our services</h2> 
<p>Access to subscription content is provided via a variety of mechanisms such as IP site licenses, login via third party federated identity providers or by a personal account with us.&nbsp;Using the federated authentication method institutional selection data may be stored locally in your browser and shared with third party websites that you visit to ease the process of institutional authentication. If your access to our content is provided by an organisation or an institution like a university or a company then they choose the access method on your behalf. A personal account is required to purchase content directly from us, or to receive personal services like newsletters and alerts.</p> 
<p>If you need to create a personal login with us then we will store and process the following:<br> <em>- Information (such as your name, user name and email address) that is provided by registration;<br> - Information in connection with an account sign-in facility (e.g. log-in and password details);<br> - Communications sent by you (e.g. via e-mail or website communication forms)</em></p> 
<p>The information that is necessary for the performance of the service is labelled accordingly. All further information is provided voluntarily.</p> 
<p>We will process the personal data you provide to:<br> <br> <em>- Identify you at sign-in;<br> - Provide you with the services and information offered through the website or which you request;<br> - Administer your account;<br> - Communicate with you;<br> - (behavioural) Advertising and profiling;<br> - Facilitate attendance of a conference;<br> - Manage manuscript submissions;<br> - Provide access (where appropriate) to other Springer Nature group content if you so request</em></p> 
<p>For this, the legal basis is Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. b GDPR. The use of your personal data for behavioural advertising and profiling is done with consent, Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. a GDPR.</p> 
<p>We use the personal data and contact data you provide by registration to inform you directly about our additional products and services. The use of your personal data for directly advertising related products and services is with consent, Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. a GDPR.</p> 
<p>You can object to the use of your personal data for direct marketing at any time. We will then refrain from any processing to the extent it is related to such purposes. You may opt-out of direct marketing via opt-out links in any marketing communication or via user profile pages on the website (where available). You can also inform us about your objection by contacting our Data Protection Office at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:dataprotection@springernature.com">dataprotection@springernature.com</a>.</p> 
<p>Registration data is kept until such time as an account deletion request is made. If such a request is received we will erase your data within 30 days. Statutory storage obligations or the need for legal actions that may arise from misconduct within the services or payment problems can lead to a longer retention of your personal data. In this case, we will inform you accordingly.</p> 
<h2>V. Information about the specific uses that require registration</h2> 
<p>1. <strong>Blogs</strong></p> 
<p>You can publicly comment on our blog where we post a variety of articles to inform you about our activities. When posting a comment your name or user name will be made public. To be able to comment on our blog you will have to register as described in IV.</p> 
<p>In addition to the extent of processing described under IV, when you post a comment we will retain some of your personal data such as your IP address and name and other metadata such as time of posting. This is necessary to defend ourselves from possible liability claims that may arise from unlawful comments posted by you and reflects our legitimate interest with regard to the legal justification of this processing activity in Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p> 
<p>We reserve the right to delete comments that are off-topic, spam, abusive, use excessive foul language, include ad hominem attacks or offend against legal regulations.</p> 
<p>2<strong>. Web shop</strong></p> 
<p>For the use of our web shop you have to set up an account as described under IV.&nbsp; Your customer account retains your personal data for future purchases. You can delete the personal data as well as the account in your account’s settings. This processing is based on Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. b.</p> 
<p>By statutory law we are required to retain the provided financial data in relation to transactions (including address, payment and order information) for ten years. However, after 2 years we will restrict the processing of your personal data to comply with the statutory requirements and will not process the personal data any further.&nbsp; Regarding this, the retention of your personal data is based on Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. c GDPR.</p> 
<p>3. <strong>Article alerts and newsletters</strong></p> 
<p>With your email address you can subscribe to our newsletters that provide you with the latest news about our products and services if you consent to receiving such newsletters. The legal basis for this processing is Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. a GDPR. Your email address will be retained as long as you subscribe to our newsletters.</p> 
<p>This service is provided by means of a double-opt-in. Thus, you will receive an email containing a link by which you can confirm that you are the owner of the email address and wish to be notified via our email service. When your subscription is not confirmed within 96 hours after the confirmation mail has been requested, the personal data you provided will not be processed for any purpose and it will be automatically erased.</p> 
<p>You can unsubscribe from this service by opting out via the link provided in each newsletter.</p> 
<p>You can sign up for newsletters and request to be contacted about our products and services via Facebook. For this purpose, we are using Facebook Lead Ads, a service by Facebook Inc., 1601 South California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304 U.S. ("Facebook"). Lead Ads makes it even easier for you to sign up to newsletters and request to be contacted as the form will already be pre-populated via Facebook with your data and you only need to submit the form. Of course, you have the opportunity to amend and review the data before submission. For more information on how lead ads works see here -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/lead-ads">https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/lead-ads</a>.</p> 
<p>The legal basis for this processing is Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. a GDPR. Your email address will be retained as long as you subscribe to our newsletters or until you request the removal of your email address.</p> 
<p>You can unsubscribe from newsletters by opting out via the link provided in each newsletter. If you inquired about a product or service and no longer wish to be contacted, you can email onlineservice@springernature.com, citing the name of the product or service, and request that your email address be removed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>a) Facebook Social Plugins</p> 
<p>We use so-called social plugins („plugins“) of the social networking site facebook.com provided by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook"). The plugins can be identified by one of Facebook’s logos (white “f” on blue tile or a “thumps-up”-sign) or by the additional text “Facebook Social Plugin”. The list of Facebook Social Plugins and their appearance can be accessed via:&nbsp;<a href="http://developers.facebook.com/plugins">http://developers.facebook.com/plugins</a>.</p> 
<p>If a user visits one of the websites using such a plugin, the user’s browser directly connects to Facebook’s servers. The plugin and its content are made available directly on Facebook’s servers and included in the website by the user’s browser.</p> 
<p>Due to the integration of the plugin Facebook collects the information that a user is visiting the corresponding website. If the user is logged in on Facebook at the moment he or she visits the website, Facebook may be able to connect the visit on the website to the user’s Facebook account. If the user interacts with the plugin – for example if he or she presses the like button or comments on something – the user’s browser transmits this information to Facebook. Facebook stores this information. If a user is not a member of Facebook, Facebook may collect and store the user’s IP-address. Facebook states that it only collects anonymized IP-addresses in Germany.</p> 
<p>The reason for and scope of the data acquisition and information about the way in which the data is processed and used by Facebook, as well as the user’s rights in this respect and settings options for protecting the users privacy can be found under:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/policy.php">http://www.facebook.com/policy.php</a>.</p> 
<p>If the user is a member of Facebook and does not wish Facebook to collect personal data via this homepage and to link this with his data stored on Facebook, the user needs to log off from Facebook before going to this homepage.</p> 
<p>The user may also block Facebook’s plugins using add-ons for the user’s browser, for example the “Facebook Blocker“.</p> 
<p>b) Twitter</p> 
<p>We use the twitter-button. The button is provided by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. (“Twitter”) The buttons are marked using the text “Twitter” or “Follow” and a stylized blue bird. The button enables the user to share an article or a website of this homepage on Twitter or to follow the provider on Twitter.</p> 
<p>If a user visits one of the websites using such a button, the user’s browser directly connects to Twitter’s servers. The Twitter-button and its content are loaded directly from Twitter’s servers and included in the website by the user’s browser. According to the provider’s knowledge, Twitter collects the user IP-address and the website’s URL when the button is loaded from Twitter’s servers. However, this data is only be used for loading and displaying the Twitter-button.</p> 
<p>Further information can be found in Twitter’s privacy statement under:&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/privacy">https://twitter.com/privacy</a>.</p>

The legal basis to share your data in this instance is Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. f GDPR, our legitimate interest to develop and improve our open access program to the benefit of authors and the scientific community generally.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Customer service, administrative, operational and systems support is provided by other entities of the Springer Nature Group and third party contractors (together “Contractors”). We may disclose your personal data to Contractors who assist us in providing the services we offer through the Submission and Peer Review System. Such a transfer will be based on data processing agreements in accordance with Article 28 of the GDPR. Therefore, our Contractors will only use your personal data to the extent necessary to perform their functions and will be contractually bound to process your personal data only on our behalf and in compliance with our requests. Further services, provided by third party technology and service providers, are similarly bound by data processing agreements.</p> 
<p>a. Research Square</p> 
<p>We work closely with Research Square (of which Springer Nature is an investor) to provide Springer Nature authors with optional services to improve their manuscript and provide greater transparency into the peer review process.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Research Square (Research Square R&amp;D LLC, 601 W. Main St. Suite 102, Durham, NC, USA) provides software and services to the research community to help them communicate, publish and promote their research.</p> 
<p>Where enabled on the journal Springer Nature authors are provided with access to a private author dashboard upon submission to the journal which provides granular insight into the status of their manuscript as it progresses through the peer-review process, and a place where authors can improve their manuscript via free and paid for services offered by Research Square, should they wish.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Where offered during submission, authors will be able to opt in to the&nbsp;<em>In Review</em>&nbsp;service which posts their manuscript as a permanent, public, preprint on the Research Square platform. The preprint will be published under a&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY license</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To be able to offer both services, Springer Nature will send Research Square R&amp;D LLC data on the author’s manuscript and status updates as it progresses through the peer-review process. The data transferred includes: manuscript metadata (title, authors (names, email addresses, corresponding author details) subject areas, keywords, funding information);&nbsp; manuscript, figure, table and supplementary information files &nbsp;(but not cover letters and any other files explicitly indicated to be for use of editorial staff only) of initial submissions only for hybrid and subscription titles, and all versions for Open Access titles; notification and date of key stages in the peer-review process. These stages include but are not limited to: passing of initial checks, manuscript assignment to an editor, peer reviewers invited, peer reviewers agreed, peer review reports returned, editorial decision. For journals that operate an open or transparent peer review model for all submitted manuscripts, the reviewer reports (but not reviewer identities) are also passed to Research Square. For these titles only the reviewer reports are posted in the private author dashboard and never publicly.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Research Square uses this data to populate the peer review timeline in the private author dashboard, and surface free and paid for services that are appropriate to the author depending on where their manuscript is within the peer-review process. If authors have opted in for the&nbsp;<em>In Review</em>&nbsp;service during submission this data will be used to post the manuscript as a public preprint and populate the public peer review timeline (if offered).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For the&nbsp;<em>Private Author Dashboard </em>your data is shared based on Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit.f GDPR and represents our legitimate interest to increase transparency of the peer review process and support authors in improving their manuscript. For&nbsp;<em>In Review&nbsp;</em>your data is shared based on Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>a GDPR, your explicit consent to this optional service.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Research Square acts as a data processor on our behalf, please see their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/legal/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>&nbsp;for further information as to how Research Square will process your data.</p>
