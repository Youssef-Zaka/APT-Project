<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Condé Nast Britain is a subsidiary of Condé Nast International, a privately-owned company; we publish twelve of the world's leading multi-media brands in the UK, listed <a href="/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Condé Nast is renowned as the authority on the latest trends in beauty, fashion, interiors and luxury products, and for influential reporting - from cutting-edge exposés in current affairs to truthful views on travel experiences. Our portfolio
    includes VOGUE, GLAMOUR, HOUSE & GARDEN, TATLER, GQ, WIRED, THE WORLD OF INTERIORS, VANITY FAIR, Condé Nast TRAVELLER, Condé Nast JOHANSENS, GQ Style and LOVE.</p>

<p>Data privacy and protection is very important to us for everyone who uses our products and services, and who entrusts us with their information. We have written this privacy notice so you can better understand how we collect data, what we do with
    it and how we look after it. We will tell you how long we keep data and what happens when we no longer need it. We will also outline what rights you have over your data and how we protect and facilitate those rights.</p>

<h2>Opting in and out of communications made easy</h2>

<p>Sometimes people want to read privacy notices because a business is asking for their permission to contact them for marketing. They want to be sure that, if they agree, it will be easy for them to withdraw permission in the future. We want you to
    be able to opt out as easily as you opted in. Any marketing email we send you will always have an "unsubscribe" link that will take you off that relevant marketing list. Please remember that you may have subscribed from another email address; you
    will only be able to use the link to "unsubscribe" from the address to which the marketing email has been sent. We make it easy for you to change your preferences for postal marketing as well, giving clear instructions for opting out on all direct
    mail.</p>

<p>If you want to change the preferences you have with us for email or for postal marketing, you can use our online form
    <a href="https://preferences.condenast.co.uk/preferences">here</a>.
</p>
<p>If you do not have an email address associated with us, and you want to make a request to opt in or out of postal marketing you can do so with this <a href="https://privacyportal-eu.onetrust.com/webform/c7543215-252a-4de7-a3a9-a93c52733953/6d61210a-f90c-4cfc-988e-9618c2bcd289" target="_blank">form</a>.  Please note that requests using this form can take up to 30 days to process.</p>

<h2 id="what_personal_data_do_we_collect_from_you">1. What personal information do we collect from you?</h2>

<p>We collect information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>when you pay for any of our products or services</li>
    <li>when you register to receive one of our newsletters</li>
    <li>when you use any of our websites</li>
    <li>when you attend any of our events</li>
    <li>if you participate in any research we undertake</li>
    <li>if you join one of our communities or forums</li>
    <li>when you enter a competition</li>
    <li>if you contact us about a query or a complaint</li>
   
</ul>


<p>We collect the following types of information:</p>

<h3>Contact information</h3>
<p>When you use or subscribe to one of our services, such as purchasing a print or digital subscription, signing up to an email newsletter, entering a competition, joining one of our online communities or participating in any of our research
    projects, we will ask you to provide information such as your name, email and/or postal address so that we can provide you with the services requested.</p>

<h3>General personal information</h3>
<p>When conducting surveys or running competitions, in addition to contact information, we may collect other personal information such as your gender, date of birth, marital status, etc.</p>

<h3>Payment details</h3>
<p>When you purchase a product or service from us, such as subscribing to one of our magazines or attending one of our events, we will also ask you for your payment details in addition to your contact information, in order to secure payment and to
    authorise access to our products and services.</p>

<h3>Online identifiers</h3>
<p>When you visit one of our websites, we collect information about your web visit, such as how long you visited, what sites you visited or pages you looked at, your IP address and where you were when you visited, what sort of device you were using
    when you visited (such as a mobile phone or type of desktop PC, Mac etc), and information identifying the language used by your Device.</p>

<h3>Behavioural data</h3>
<p>When you visit one of our websites, we collect data on your online behaviour (eg time spent on website, items clicked on, etc).</p>

<p>When you buy a product or service from us, such as magazine subscription or a ticket to a Condé Nast event, we will collect information about what products and services you have bought from us.</p>

<p>When you register for a newsletter or take part in research, we may collect data about your preferences, tastes and interests.</p>



<h3>"Special" categories of data</h3>
<p>Sometimes, we may collect data in online surveys on what is called "special categories of data". These could be data sets such as biometric information (including voice samples, facial recognition, etc), or political opinions, religion,
    philosophical beliefs, health, sexual orientation, etc. Whenever we conduct research on these topics, it is always optional, and we will make sure we have your consent to process this data. We will remind you at the time of why and how we are
    processing this data and what additional safeguards are in place for using, storing and ultimately either deleting or anonymising this data.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how_do_we_use_your_personal_information">2. How do we use your personal information?</h2>
<p>At Condé Nast Britain we collect different types of information about people for four main reasons:</p>
<ol>
    <li>To provide personalised services unique to individual users.</li>
    <li>So we can monitor and improve the services we offer.</li>
    <li>To sell advertising space on our websites. This helps us to keep our websites free for people who visit them.</li>
    <li>To market products and services which we think would be relevant to you.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Newsletters</h3>
<p>When you sign up to one of our newsletters, you are giving consent for us to use the email address provided to send you relevant content for the brands you have signed up to. You can withdraw this consent for any newsletter by unsubscribing at any
    time.</p>

<h3>Advertising</h3>
<p>We advertise on our site and in our newsletters to help keep most of the content free. We use cookies and similar technologies and work with trusted partners so that we can show you advertisements we believe might interest you, to control the
    number of times you see an ad and to measure the effectiveness of a campaign. We have a legitimate interest in using cookies but you can opt in or out of using them at any time. If you are interested and want to learn more about these, including how to opt out, please see our <a href="/cookie-notice/">Cookie Policy</a>. Please
    note, opting out of cookies does not mean you will not see any advertisements.</p>

<h3>Social Media Advertising</h3>
<p>We work with social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter to show you marketing content from our brands and selected advertisers if you have viewed a Condé Nast website and to make sure what we show you on these platforms is relevant to you. Data collected by these social media networks may also
    be anonymised and used in aggregate to help improve the quality and effectiveness of our websites and marketing efforts.</p>

<p>You can limit this kind of tracking and profiling by going to your account settings of Facebook and/or Twitter. You can also find out more about the pixels and cookies we use on our websites by reading our <a href="/cookie-notice/">Cookies policy</a>.</p>

<p>We may also participate in Facebook's 'Custom Audience' service from time to time. This service enables Condé Nast to display to you personalised advertisements when you visit Facebook’s social media platforms. It works by converting your email
    address to a unique number that Facebook uses to match to unique numbers that Facebook generates from email addresses of its users. Where we use Facebook Custom Audiences, we will only include you if you have consented to receive marketing from us.
    If you have given us your consent, you can change your mind at any time by unsubscribing (linked in any email we send you) or by adjusting your preferences in our <a href="https://preferences.condenast.co.uk/preferences">preference centre</a>.</p>

<h3>Research & Insight</h3>
<p>We run various user communities, forums and reader panels. We send out research invitations to our research communities, to people who pay for our products and services and to people who have opted in to receive communications from us.</p>

<p>We may sometimes use your gender and age range collected during a survey for building "look-a-like" models. This data is anonymously transmitted to our Data Management Platform (Permutive) and matched with our subscribers and members. This allows us to provide relevant and targeted advertising. If you are interested and want to learn more about these, including how to opt out, please see our <a href="/cookie-notice/">Cookie Policy</a>. Please
    note, opting out of cookies does not mean you will not see any advertisements.</p>

<h3>Delivery of goods and services / Customer account management</h3>
<p>We will use the information you have provided for the provision of goods and/or services that you have requested and subsequently communicating with you about those products and services.</p>

<p>Please note too, that when you buy something from us - such as subscription or a ticket to an event - we may contact you about your registration details, to manage any account or subscription you have with us, or to provide customer service. This
    will be the case even if you have opted-out of, or declined to consent to, receiving promotional emails.</p>

<h3>Competitions</h3>
<p>When you enter one of our online competitions, we will process your information for the purposes of picking a winner. If you have opted-in to receiving information from us about our products and services (eg receiving subscriptions offers, event
    invitations, signing up for editorial newsletters etc) then we will use the information you provide to make sure we offer you relevant products and services (based on where you live, your age, gender, tastes, preferences etc). If you have opted-in
    to receive news and offers from any competition sponsors, we will share your information with them.</p>

<p>Further details about this is outlined in the "who do we share information with" with section.</p>

<h3>Partnerships programmes</h3>
<p>We work with our partners from the world of luxury goods, fashion, travel and retail so that we can present you with some outstanding offers and opportunities by either email or post. You will only ever receive partner messages from us if you have
    actively given permission. We won’t disclose your personal information to anyone, the messages will come from us and you can unsubscribe at any time from these messages.</p>

<h3>Customer queries and complaints</h3>
<p>We process any information you provide when dealing with any complaints or enquiries made by you or legally on your behalf.</p>



<hr />

<h2 id="legal_bases_for_data_processing_what_does_it_mean_and_how_do_we_use_them">3. Legal bases for data processing –
    what does it mean and how do we use them?</h2>

<p>The law on data protection sets out several different reasons why a company may collect and process your personal data and it is one of our duties to make sure you understand which of these lawful bases we are using to process your data.</p>

<h3>Consent</h3>
<p>In specific situations, we can collect and process your data with your consent:</p>

<ul>
    <li>When you sign up to any editorial newsletter</li>
    <li>When you tick a box to receive email from Condé Nast about news and offers</li>
    <li>When you tick a box to consent to receive email from Condé Nast on behalf of our partners</li>
    <li>We send SMS messages, either from Condé Nast or on behalf of our partners with your consent</li>
    <li>When you give us your details to enter a competition</li>
    <li>When you participate in any research, this is with your consent</li>
  
</ul>

<h3>Legitimate interest</h3>
<p>In specific situations, we require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests:</p>

<ul>
    <li>We personalise the marketing content we provide you </li>
    <li>If you have bought a product or service from us, we will also use your details to send you direct marketing information by email or post, telling you about products and services that we think might interest you</li>
    <li>If you have bought a product or service from us we will send you direct marketing on behalf of our partners</li>
</ul>

<p>We will only use legitimate interest after we have properly evaluated the data processing and conducted a necessary balancing test. We will also give data subjects the right to object to the processing at any time.</p>

<h3>Contractual obligations</h3>
<p>In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligations.</p>
<p>For example, when you purchase a print subscription to a magazine, we will keep your name and address to fulfil your
    subscription.</p>

<h3>Legal compliance</h3>
<p>If the law requires us to, we may need to collect and process your data.</p>

<p>For example, we can pass on details of people involved in fraud or other criminal activity affecting us to law
    enforcement.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="do_we_share_your_information_with_anyone_else">4. Do we share your information with anyone else?</h2>

<h3>Condé Nast International and its subsidiaries</h3>
<p>We may share your personal information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>With our parent company, Condé Nast International </li>
    <li>If all or any of our assets (eg a title owned by us) were to be sold to another business, the personal data relating to that title (eg the subscriber list / newsletter list etc) would be transferred to the new business owner.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Service providers</h3>
<p>We work with service providers to perform some tasks on our behalf. This might include analysis, payments, marketing, identity management, IT services. This may include personal information and non-personal site usage information to provide
    aggregate demographics on our audiences. We may share your personal data with these providers to perform the necessary tasks. However, they are obliged not to disclose or use it for any other purposes. Any third-party processing of your data on our
    behalf will be subject to security and confidentiality obligations consistent with this privacy notice and applicable law.</p>

<h3>Customer research & insight</h3>
<p>We may disclose de-personalised data (such as aggregated statistics) about the audience of our products and services and/or research participants to describe our sales, customers, traffic patterns and other information to prospective
    partners, advertisers, investors and other reputable third parties, and for other lawful purposes. These statistics will never include identifiable personal information.</p>

<h3>Law enforcement organisations</h3>
<p>Under certain circumstances we may occasionally be required by law, court order or governmental authority to disclose certain types of personal information and we reserve the right to comply with any such legally binding request.</p>

<h3>Marketing partners</h3>
<p>With your explicit permission, we may share your information with other companies we are working with, such as competition sponsors. Whenever we share your information with another company, we will
    always ask for your permission, will name the company and will always be clear that your information will be shared with another organisation.</p>


<hr />

<h2 id="do_we_collect_information_on_children">5. Collecting data on children</h2>
<p>We do not knowingly collect and process information from children (anyone under the age of 13). The products and services we offer are generally aimed at people aged 18 and over.</p>

<p>If you are under the age of 13, we ask that you do not give us any information about you or use our websites.</p>

<p>If you are a parent or guardian of a child under 13 and you if you think that your child has used our websites or
    subscribed to a newsletter or provided their information to us without your consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:datacontroller@condenast.co.uk">datacontroller@condenast.co.uk</a> and we will delete and/or stop
    processing your child’s personal information within a reasonable time.</p>

<p>If you are aged between 13 and 18, we request that you seek your parent or guardian’s permission before providing us
    with your information or using our websites or apps.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how_long_will_we_keep_your_data">6. How long will we keep data?</h2>

<p>We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide the individual service/s you have requested, while taking into account any legal requirements and tax and accounting rules. We do not store customer data for longer than
    6 years after the last purchase.</p>

<p>Where you sign up to receive email marketing from us we will retain your e-mail address after you ‘opt-out’ of receiving emails to ensure that we continue to honour and respect that request. To unsubscribe from marketing emails at any time, please
    click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any marketing email and update your account preferences. You may also use our <a href="https://preferences.condenast.co.uk/preferences">preference centre</a> to update what postal or email
    communications you wish you receive from us.</p>

<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see ‘<a href="#your_data_rights">Your rights</a>’ below for
    further information.</p>

<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="profiling_what_do_we_mean">7. Profiling</h2>

<p>We may sometimes use the data you share with us, and that we collect about you when browsing our websites and products, to personalise our services and to tailor marketing content. For example, we may use information you have provided to send you information about products we think you may be interested in. If you do not want to receive this material, you can unsubscribe at any point.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="data_security_and_cross_border_transfers">8. Cross-border transfers and security</h2>
<p>We make sure that we have appropriate security measures to protect your information and make sure that, when we ask another organisation to provide a service for us, they have appropriate security measures and follow the same high standards of
    security and data protection as we do.</p>

<p>If we or our service providers transfer any information out of the European Economic Area (EEA), it will only be done with the relevant protection (stated under UK law) being in place.</p>

<hr />

<p>We receive commission on some of the links to third party websites offering products and services that we feature on our websites. We work with a third party to help us attribute e-commerce traffic. You can find out more in our <a href="/cookie-notice/">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>

<h3>Notice to California Customers - Your Privacy Rights</h3>

<p>
    <strong>A. Consumer Privacy.</strong> The California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Civ. Code §1798.100 et. seq.
    ("CCPA"), grants residents of California certain rights with respect to their Personal Information and requires us
    to provide such individuals with certain information, described in this Section X(A).
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        California residents may exercise the following rights by contacting our Privacy Notice Coordinator by email at
        <a href="mailto:datacontroller@condenast.co.uk">datacontroller@condenast.co.uk</a> or phone at +1 888-914-9661,
        PIN: 867 610, or as described at the end of this document:
        <ul>
            <li>Know the ways in which we acquire, use, share, disclose and otherwise process your Personal Information
            </li>
            <li>Know the specific pieces of your Personal Information that we hold</li>
            <li>Request the deletion of your Personal Information, subject to several exceptions, and</li>
            <li>Not to be denied goods or services for exercising these rights</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>California residents also have the right to opt-out of the "sale" of their Personal Information. We put "sale" in quotation marks because the CCPA considers some transfers of Personal Information to third parties in exchange for value as
        "sales," even if no money changes hands, such as when online identifiers, Device IDs, and other information is shared with Third Party Businesses to further their own commercial purposes such as generating profiles about individuals. If we have
        actual knowledge that a California resident is younger than 16, we will request opt-in consent before selling their Personal Information. Note that we can still share Personal Information with third parties if those transfers aren’t "sales," such
        as with our Service Providers.</li>
    <li>Depending on the circumstances and which Service you use, we have disclosed the following categories of your
        Personal Information for a "business purpose" (as defined in the CCPA) in the preceding twelve (12) months:
        <ul>
            <li>Identifiers</li>
            <li>Protected characteristics</li>
            <li>Commercial information</li>
            <li>Geolocation data</li>
            <li>Internet or other electronic network activity information</li>
            <li>Financial, medical, or health insurance information</li>
            <li>Audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory, or similar information</li>
            <li>Professional information</li>
            <li>Education information</li>
            <li>Inferences drawn from any of the above information categories.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Depending on the circumstances and which Service you use, we have "sold" (as defined in the CCPA) the following
        categories of your Personal Information in the preceding twelve (12) months:
        <ul>
            <li>Identifiers</li>
            <li>Protected characteristics</li>
            <li>Commercial information</li>
            <li>Geolocation data</li>
            <li>Internet or other electronic network activity information</li>
            <li>Inferences drawn from any of the above information categories, along with the following categories: (i)
                financial, medical, or health insurance information; (ii) audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory,
                or similar information; (iii) professional information, and (iv) education information.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    <strong>B. Shine the Light.</strong> California’s "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code Section 1798.83, gives California customers the right to prevent our disclosure of their Personal Information to third parties for those third parties’ direct
    marketing purposes, and requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business' practices related to disclosing Personal Information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
    Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose Personal Information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such
    information-sharing. We have such a policy in place.
</p>

<p><strong>C. Online Erasure.</strong> California’s "Online Erasure" law, Business and Professions Code Sections 22580-22582, requires operators of certain websites and online services to allow registered users who are under the age of 18 and
    residents of California to request removal of Content they post. If you fit that description and posted Content on a section of our Service that is directed to minors, you may request removal of the Content by contacting our Privacy Notice
    Coordinator by email at datacontroller@condenast.co.uk or as described at the end of this document. In response to your request, we may elect to make the Content invisible to other users and the public (rather than deleting it entirely), in which
    case the Content may remain on servers we control and/or may be publicly available elsewhere if a third party copied and reposted the Content.</p>
