Every five minutes, you can add one pixel of any color. The result is thousands of Redditors working together (or against each other!) to carve out a visual space for their community, country, sports team, favorite video game, or a co-operative pixelated Mona Lisa.\nThis fascinating social experiment has been conducted twice on Reddit, but also has roots in a similar gambit from 2005 called \"The Million Dollar Homepage,\" where pixels were sold to any person (or brand) with enough cash to make a statement on this early Web billboard.\nAlli and Lindsey speak with Jay Hoffman, who documents this and many other Internet phenomena in his \"History of the Web\" newsletter. They discuss the extraordinary artwork created on this collaborative free-for-all, and why it never devolved into madness, thanks to a variety of self-policing communities.\nRead Jay's issue and subscribe to his fantastic newsletter here: https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/the-power-of-the-pixel/\nSupport 2G1P on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/2G1P\nJoin the 2G1P Discord community: http://discord.gg/2g1p\nJoin the 2G1P Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/2girls1podcast/\nEmail us: 2G1Podcast@gmail.com\nCall the show and leave a message!

But how did this highly compressed CompuServe image format from 1987 become the ubiquitous communication method bursting from all of our smartphone keyboards?\nNearly all the coverage of Wilhite's death links back to one interview from 2012. Fernando Alfonso, III, a reporter at The Daily Dot (fine publisher of this very podcast!) tracked down the reclusive Wilhite to discuss the legacy of the .GIF, and why it became so pivotal in the maturation of the Web. Alfonso (now a supervising editor at NPR) explains why .GIFs were invented, why they blossomed with artists of the early Web, how hard it was to make them in the early aughts, and whether we should expect the .GIF to survive the next 10 years.\nRead Fernando's piece from 2012: https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/gif-history-steve-wilhite-olia-lialina-interview/\nFollow Fernando: https://twitter.com/fernalfonso\nSupport 2G1P on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/2G1P\nJoin the 2G1P Discord community: http://discord.gg/2g1p\nJoin the 2G1P Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/2girls1podcast/\nEmail us: 2G1Podcast@gmail.com\nCall the show and leave a message!

It may sound like another Internet conspiracy theory, but this one is the real deal. Shortwave radio transmissions are among the most reliable ways for military, government, and intelligence agencies to exchange information. And every day for the last 40 years, one shortwave radio station called UVB-76 has been broadcasting static, beeping patterns, and cryptic Russian messages to ... someone. The contents of the messages are unknown — they are re-encrypted regularly. Anyone can listen, but only the intended recipient(s) can decode them. But that doesn't stop a thriving community of online listeners who stream these stations for the entire Internet to hear, in the hopes of finding patterns or clues.\nAlli and Lindsey speak with ZapdoZ, a YouTube streamer who also moderates a large Discord server devoted to cataloging the cryptic messages of this Russian military shortwave transmission. He explains the difference between Numbers Stations (for spies) and Military Stations (for armed forces), why streamers use spectral analysis to \"look\" at the sound, and how chatter on these stations may have hinted at the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nSupport 2G1P on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/2G1P\nJoin the 2G1P Discord community: http://discord.gg/2g1p\nJoin the 2G1P Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/2girls1podcast/\nEmail us: 2G1Podcast@gmail.com\nCall the show and leave a message!

It was the most popular blogging platform on the Internet...until it wasn't. But the communities that formed there have had a lasting impact on social media, notably the passionate fandoms that exploded in the mid-2010s\nAlli and Lindsey speak with Elena Cavender, culture fellow at Mashable, who recently wrote the piece \"Remembering Tumblr's strangest, most formative communities.\" It's a nostalgic look back at the single-serve \"Fuckyeah\" culture that celebrated everything from movie posters to history crushes, and everything in-between: Fanfiction, study communities, Supernatural, Doctor Who, Sherlock, One Direction, serial killers, and even the legacy of destructive content like pro-anorexia blogs.\nElena walks us through the heyday of Tumblr (and its rapid demise), and how those communities inform today's Internet.\nRead her piece: https://mashable.com/article/tumblr-best-communities-nostalgia\nSupport 2G1P on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/2G1P\nJoin the 2G1P Discord community: http://discord.gg/2g1p\nJoin the 2G1P Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/2girls1podcast/\nEmail us: 2G1Podcast@gmail.com\nCall the show and leave a message!

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>r/Place is a blank canvas on Reddit. Every five minutes, you can add one pixel of any color. The result is thousands of Redditors working together (or against each other!) to carve out a visual space for their community, country, sports team, favorite video game, or a co-operative pixelated Mona Lisa.<br />This fascinating social experiment has been conducted twice on Reddit, but also has roots in a similar gambit from 2005 called &quot;The Million Dollar Homepage,&quot; where pixels were sold to any person (or brand) with enough cash to make a statement on this early Web billboard.<br />Alli and Lindsey speak with Jay Hoffman, who documents this and many other Internet phenomena in his &quot;History of the Web&quot; newsletter. They discuss the extraordinary artwork created on this collaborative free-for-all, and why it never devolved into madness, thanks to a variety of self-policing communities.<br />Read Jay&#39;s issue and subscribe to his fantastic newsletter here: https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/the-power-of-the-pixel/<br />Support 2G1P on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/2G1P<br />Join the 2G1P Discord community: http://discord.gg/2g1p<br />Join the 2G1P Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/2girls1podcast/<br />Email us: 2G1Podcast@gmail.com<br />Call the show and leave a message!

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>When Stephen Wilhite, the creator of the .GIF image, died last month at the age of 74, millions on the Internet shared their favorite (and earliest-known) looping animations in honor of the influential computer scientist. But how did this highly compressed CompuServe image format from 1987 become the ubiquitous communication method bursting from all of our smartphone keyboards?<br />Nearly all the coverage of Wilhite&#39;s death links back to one interview from 2012. Fernando Alfonso, III, a reporter at The Daily Dot (fine publisher of this very podcast!) tracked down the reclusive Wilhite to discuss the legacy of the .GIF, and why it became so pivotal in the maturation of the Web. Alfonso (now a supervising editor at NPR) explains why .GIFs were invented, why they blossomed with artists of the early Web, how hard it was to make them in the early aughts, and whether we should expect the .GIF to survive the next 10 years.<br />Read Fernando&#39;s piece from 2012: https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/gif-history-steve-wilhite-olia-lialina-interview/<br />Follow Fernando: https://twitter.com/fernalfonso<br />Support 2G1P on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/2G1P<br />Join the 2G1P Discord community: http://discord.gg/2g1p<br />Join the 2G1P Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/2girls1podcast/<br />Email us: 2G1Podcast@gmail.com<br />Call the show and leave a message!

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Secret spy messages are &quot;hiding&quot; in the airwaves all around us. It may sound like another Internet conspiracy theory, but this one is the real deal. Shortwave radio transmissions are among the most reliable ways for military, government, and intelligence agencies to exchange information. And every day for the last 40 years, one shortwave radio station called UVB-76 has been broadcasting static, beeping patterns, and cryptic Russian messages to ... someone. The contents of the messages are unknown — they are re-encrypted regularly. Anyone can listen, but only the intended recipient(s) can decode them. But that doesn&#39;t stop a thriving community of online listeners who stream these stations for the entire Internet to hear, in the hopes of finding patterns or clues.<br />Alli and Lindsey speak with ZapdoZ, a YouTube streamer who also moderates a large Discord server devoted to cataloging the cryptic messages of this Russian military shortwave transmission. He explains the difference between Numbers Stations (for spies) and Military Stations (for armed forces), why streamers use spectral analysis to &quot;look&quot; at the sound, and how chatter on these stations may have hinted at the Russian invasion of Ukraine.<br />Support 2G1P on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/2G1P<br />Join the 2G1P Discord community: http://discord.gg/2g1p<br />Join the 2G1P Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/2girls1podcast/<br />Email us: 2G1Podcast@gmail.com<br />Call the show and leave a message!

But the communities that formed there have had a lasting impact on social media, notably the passionate fandoms that exploded in the mid-2010s<br />Alli and Lindsey speak with Elena Cavender, culture fellow at Mashable, who recently wrote the piece &quot;Remembering Tumblr&#39;s strangest, most formative communities.&quot; It&#39;s a nostalgic look back at the single-serve &quot;Fuckyeah&quot; culture that celebrated everything from movie posters to history crushes, and everything in-between: Fanfiction, study communities, Supernatural, Doctor Who, Sherlock, One Direction, serial killers, and even the legacy of destructive content like pro-anorexia blogs.<br />Elena walks us through the heyday of Tumblr (and its rapid demise), and how those communities inform today&#39;s Internet.<br />Read her piece: https://mashable.com/article/tumblr-best-communities-nostalgia<br />Support 2G1P on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/2G1P<br />Join the 2G1P Discord community: http://discord.gg/2g1p<br />Join the 2G1P Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/2girls1podcast/<br />Email us: 2G1Podcast@gmail.com<br />Call the show and leave a message!

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love this show. It’s hilarious, thoughtful and uncomfortable (in the best way.) The topics they discuss are discussed in a fair way and educate on those topics. There are more topics than I can list that, as soon as I read the title, made me think that this topic is just ridiculous and not even worth talking about. After listening to this show I realized I actually knew nothing about a topic that at one time (shamefully) upset me, and made me learn what The topic is really about, made me look inside and find out why it upset me, and realize that it’s not nearly what I thought it was and why it shouldn’t upset me.</p>

Fernando Alfonso, III, a reporter at The Daily Dot (fine publisher of this very podcast!) tracked down the reclusive Wilhite to discuss the legacy of the .GIF, and why it became so pivotal in the maturation of the Web. Alfonso (now a supervising editor at NPR) explains why .GIFs were invented, why they blossomed with artists of the early Web, how hard it was to make them in the early aughts, and whether we should expect the .GIF to survive the next 10 years.\\nRead Fernando's piece from 2012: https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/gif-history-steve-wilhite-olia-lialina-interview/\\nFollow Fernando: https://twitter.com/fernalfonso\\nSupport 2G1P on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/2G1P\\nJoin the 2G1P Discord community: http://discord.gg/2g1p\\nJoin the 2G1P Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/2girls1podcast/\\nEmail us: 2G1Podcast@gmail.com\\nCall the show and leave a message!

It may sound like another Internet conspiracy theory, but this one is the real deal. Shortwave radio transmissions are among the most reliable ways for military, government, and intelligence agencies to exchange information. And every day for the last 40 years, one shortwave radio station called UVB-76 has been broadcasting static, beeping patterns, and cryptic Russian messages to ... someone. The contents of the messages are unknown — they are re-encrypted regularly. Anyone can listen, but only the intended recipient(s) can decode them. But that doesn't stop a thriving community of online listeners who stream these stations for the entire Internet to hear, in the hopes of finding patterns or clues.\\nAlli and Lindsey speak with ZapdoZ, a YouTube streamer who also moderates a large Discord server devoted to cataloging the cryptic messages of this Russian military shortwave transmission. He explains the difference between Numbers Stations (for spies) and Military Stations (for armed forces), why streamers use spectral analysis to \\\"look\\\" at the sound, and how chatter on these stations may have hinted at the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\\nSupport 2G1P on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/2G1P\\nJoin the 2G1P Discord community: http://discord.gg/2g1p\\nJoin the 2G1P Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/2girls1podcast/\\nEmail us: 2G1Podcast@gmail.com\\nCall the show and leave a message!
