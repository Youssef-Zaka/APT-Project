Each biome and habitat comes with its own selection of flora and fauna, and it may include physical features such as canyons, volcanoes, rivers, or caves. Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest. Shifting trends in human migration have resulted in a human geography that is profoundly different from that of centuries ago.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg","altText":"Geography & Travel","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg"}},{"id":3000,"title":"Health & Medicine","urlTitle":"Health-Medicine","description":"The study of the human mind and body, how these function, and how they interact—not only with each other but also with their environment—has been of utmost importance in ensuring human well-being.

The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale. It has led to large-scale social movements and reforms concerning issues such as suffrage, slavery, women's rights, racism, environmentalism, gay rights, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/11/195611-131-4DFC1336/Belgian-pride-parade-People-streets-flags-Brussels-2017.jpg","altText":"Lifestyles & Social Issues","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/11/195611-131-4DFC1336/Belgian-pride-parade-People-streets-flags-Brussels-2017.jpg"}},{"id":12000,"title":"Literature","urlTitle":"Literature","description":"With the development of language, the human imagination has found a way to create and communicate through the written word.

The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next?

The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science.

In both team and solo sports, the human body has been pushed to its limits in the name of improving athletic performance and in order to break record upon record. The ancient Olympic Games are an early example of the contests in which humans have engaged to showcase physical prowess. In modern times, sports and games have evolved into a lucrative and competitive industry, while other leisure activities, such as card and video games, can be competitive or just serve as a way to unwind or socialize.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg","altText":"Sports & Recreation","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg"}},{"id":2000,"title":"Technology","urlTitle":"Technology","description":"Humankind has long striven to improve its living conditions through the development of tools, instruments, and transportation and communications systems, all with the goal of making our lives easier, more productive and—why not?—more fun, too.

Occasionally, the scribes loosened up a bit: one problem (Rhind papyrus, problem 79), for example, seeks the total from seven houses, seven cats per house, seven mice per cat, seven ears of wheat per mouse, and seven <em>hekat</em> of grain per ear (result: 19,607). Certainly the scribe’s interest in progressions (for which he appears to have a rule) goes beyond practical <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="considerations" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/considerations" data-type="EB">considerations</a>.

The scribes managed to work out the basic arithmetic and geometry necessary for their official duties as civil managers, and their methods persisted with little evident change for at least a millennium, perhaps two.

In its basic manner this Greek tradition was much like the earlier traditions in Egypt and Mesopotamia. Indeed, it is likely that the Greeks borrowed from such older sources to some extent.</p><!--[P6]--><span class="marker p6"></span><!--[AM6]--><span class="marker AM6 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD6]--><span class="marker MOD6 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">What was distinctive of the Greeks’ contribution to mathematics—and what in effect made them the creators of “mathematics,” as the term is usually understood—was its development as a theoretical <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="discipline" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/discipline" data-type="MW">discipline</a>. This means two things: mathematical statements are general, and they are confirmed by <span id="ref536069"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/proof-logic" class="md-crosslink">proof</a>. For example, the Mesopotamians had procedures for finding whole numbers <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> for which <em>a</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>b</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>c</em><sup>2</sup> (e.g., 3, 4, 5; 5, 12, 13; or 119, 120, 169). From the Greeks came a proof of a general rule for finding all such sets of numbers (now called <span id="ref536070"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Pythagorean-triple" class="md-crosslink">Pythagorean triples</a>): if one takes any whole numbers <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, both being even or both odd, then <em>a</em> = (<em>p</em><sup>2</sup> − <em>q</em><sup>2</sup>)/2, <em>b</em> = <em>p</em><em>q</em>, and <em>c</em> = (<em>p</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>q</em><sup>2</sup>)/2. As Euclid proves in Book X of the <em><span id="ref536071"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Elements-by-Euclid" class="md-crosslink">Elements</a></em>, numbers of this form satisfy the relation for Pythagorean triples. Further, the Mesopotamians appear to have understood that sets of such numbers <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> form the sides of right triangles, but the Greeks proved this result (Euclid, in fact, proves it twice: in <em>Elements</em>, Book I, proposition 47, and in a more general form in <em>Elements</em>, Book VI, proposition 31), and these proofs occur in the <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="context" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/context" data-type="MW">context</a> of a systematic presentation of the properties of plane geometric figures.</p><!--[P7]--><span class="marker p7"></span><!--[AM7]--><span class="marker AM7 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD7]--><span class="marker MOD7 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">The <em>Elements</em>, composed by <span id="ref536072"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Euclid-Greek-mathematician" class="md-crosslink">Euclid</a> of Alexandria about 300 <span class="text-smallcaps">bce</span>, was the pivotal contribution to theoretical geometry, but the transition from practical to theoretical mathematics had occurred much earlier, sometime in the 5th century <span class="text-smallcaps">bce</span>. Initiated by men like <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pythagoras" class="md-crosslink">Pythagoras of Samos</a> (late 6th century) and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hippocrates-of-Chios" class="md-crosslink">Hippocrates of Chios</a> (late 5th century), the theoretical form of geometry was advanced by others, most prominently the Pythagorean <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Archytas-of-Tarentum" class="md-crosslink">Archytas of Tarentum</a>, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Theaetetus" class="md-crosslink">Theaetetus of Athens</a>, and <span id="ref536073"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Eudoxus-of-Cnidus" class="md-crosslink">Eudoxus of Cnidus</a> (4th century). Because the actual writings of these men do not survive, knowledge about their work depends on remarks made by later writers. While even this limited evidence reveals how heavily Euclid depended on them, it does not <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/set-mathematics-and-logic" class="md-crosslink autoxref">set</a> out clearly the motives behind their studies.</p><!--[P8]--><span class="marker p8"></span><!--[AM8]--><span class="marker AM8 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD8]--><span class="marker MOD8 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">It is thus a matter of debate how and why this theoretical transition took place. A frequently cited factor is the discovery of <span id="ref536074"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/irrational-number" class="md-crosslink">irrational numbers</a>. The early <span id="ref536075"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Pythagoreanism" class="md-crosslink">Pythagoreans</a> held that “all things are number.” This might be taken to mean that any geometric <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/measure-mathematics" class="md-crosslink autoxref">measure</a> can be associated with some number (that is, some whole number or fraction; in modern terminology, rational number), for in Greek usage the term for number, <em>arithmos</em>, refers exclusively to whole numbers or, in some <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="contexts" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/contexts" data-type="MW">contexts</a>, to ordinary fractions. This assumption is common enough in practice, as when the length of a given <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/line-mathematics" class="md-crosslink autoxref">line</a> is said to be so many feet plus a fractional part. However, it breaks down for the lines that form the side and diagonal of the <span id="ref536076"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/square-mathematics" class="md-crosslink">square</a>. (For example, if it is supposed that the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ratio" class="md-crosslink autoxref">ratio</a> between the side and diagonal may be expressed as the ratio of two whole numbers, it can be shown that both of these numbers must be even. This is impossible, since every <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/fraction" class="md-crosslink autoxref">fraction</a> may be expressed as a ratio of two whole numbers having no common factors.) Geometrically, this means that there is no length that could serve as a unit of measure of both the side and diagonal; that is, the side and diagonal cannot each equal the same length multiplied by (different) whole numbers. Accordingly, the Greeks called such pairs of lengths “<span id="ref536077"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Incommensurables-1688515" class="md-crosslink">incommensurable</a>.” (In modern <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="terminology" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/terminology" data-type="EB">terminology</a>, unlike that of the Greeks, the term “number” is applied to such quantities as <span class="md-root"><span class="ada-visuallyhidden">Square root of</span><span class="root-symbol">√</span><span class="root-content">2</span></span>, but they are called irrational.)</p><!--[P9]--><span class="marker p9"></span><!--[AM9]--><span class="marker AM9 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD9]--><span class="marker MOD9 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">This result was already well known at the time of Plato and may well have been discovered within the school of Pythagoras in the 5th century <span class="text-smallcaps">bce</span>, as some late authorities like <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pappus-of-Alexandria" class="md-crosslink">Pappus of Alexandria</a> (4th century <span class="text-smallcaps">ce</span>) maintain. In any case, by 400 <span class="text-smallcaps">bce</span> it was known that lines corresponding to <span class="md-root"><span class="ada-visuallyhidden">Square root of</span><span class="root-symbol">√</span><span class="root-content">3</span></span>, <span class="md-root"><span class="ada-visuallyhidden">Square root of</span><span class="root-symbol">√</span><span class="root-content">5</span></span>, and other square roots are incommensurable with a fixed unit length. The more general result, the geometric equivalent of the theorem that <span class="md-root"><span class="ada-visuallyhidden">Square root of</span><span class="root-symbol">√</span><span class="root-content"><em>p</em></span></span> is irrational whenever <em>p</em> is not a rational square number, is associated with Plato’s friend <span id="ref536078"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Theaetetus" class="md-crosslink">Theaetetus</a>. Both Theaetetus and Eudoxus contributed to the further study of irrationals, and their followers collected the results into a substantial theory, as represented by the 115 propositions of Book X of the <em>Elements</em>.</p><!--[P10]--><span class="marker p10"></span><!--[AM10]--><span class="marker AM10 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD10]--><span class="marker MOD10 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">The discovery of irrationals must have affected the very nature of early mathematical research, for it made clear that arithmetic was insufficient for the purposes of geometry, despite the assumptions made in practical work. Further, once such seemingly obvious assumptions as the commensurability of all lines turned out to be in fact false, then in principle all mathematical assumptions were rendered suspect. At the least it became necessary to justify carefully all claims made about mathematics. Even more basically, it became necessary to establish what a reasoning has to be like to qualify as a proof. Apparently, Hippocrates of Chios, in the 5th century <span class="text-smallcaps">bce</span>, and others soon after him had already begun the work of organizing geometric results into a systematic form in textbooks called “elements” (meaning “fundamental results” of geometry). These were to serve as sources for Euclid in his <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="comprehensive" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/comprehensive" data-type="MW">comprehensive</a> textbook a century later.</p><!--[P11]--><span class="marker p11"></span><!--[AM11]--><span class="marker AM11 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD11]--><span class="marker MOD11 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">The early mathematicians were not an isolated <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/group-mathematics" class="md-crosslink autoxref">group</a> but part of a larger, intensely competitive <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="intellectual" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intellectual" data-type="MW">intellectual</a> <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="environment" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environment" data-type="MW">environment</a> of <span id="ref536079"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/pre-Socratics" class="md-crosslink">pre-Socratic</a> thinkers in Ionia and Italy, as well as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sophist-philosophy" class="md-crosslink">Sophists</a> at Athens.

It is known, however, that questions about <span id="ref536087"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/parallel-postulate" class="md-crosslink">parallels</a> were debated in Aristotle’s school (c. 350 <span class="text-smallcaps">bce</span>), and so it may be assumed that efforts to prove results—such as the theorem stating that for any given line and given point, there always exists a <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="unique" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/unique" data-type="EB">unique</a> line through that point and parallel to the line—were tried and failed. Thus, the decision to found the theory of parallels on a postulate, as in Book I of the <em>Elements</em>, must have been a relatively recent development in Euclid’s time. (The postulate would later become the subject of much study, and in modern times it led to the discovery of the so-called <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/non-Euclidean-geometry" class="md-crosslink">non-Euclidean geometries</a>.)</p><!--[P16]--><span class="marker p16"></span><!--[AM16]--><span class="marker AM16 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD16]--><span class="marker MOD16 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">Book V sets out a general theory of proportion—that is, a theory that does not require any restriction to commensurable magnitudes. This general theory derives from Eudoxus. On the basis of the theory, Book VI describes the properties of <span id="ref536088"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/similarity-mathematics" class="md-crosslink">similar</a> plane rectilinear figures and so generalizes the congruence theory of Book I. It appears that the technique of similar figures was already known in the 5th century <span class="text-smallcaps">bce</span>, even though a fully valid justification could not have been given before Eudoxus worked out his theory of proportion.</p><!--[P17]--><span class="marker p17"></span><!--[AM17]--><span class="marker AM17 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD17]--><span class="marker MOD17 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">Books VII–IX deal with what the Greeks called “<span id="ref536089"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/arithmetic" class="md-crosslink">arithmetic</a>,” the theory of whole numbers. It includes the properties of numerical proportions, greatest common divisors, least common multiples, and relative primes (Book VII); propositions on numerical progressions and square and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/cube-mathematics" class="md-crosslink autoxref">cube</a> numbers (Book VIII); and special results, like unique factorization into primes, the existence of an unlimited number of primes, and the formation of “<span id="ref536090"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/perfect-number" class="md-crosslink">perfect numbers</a>”—that is, those numbers that equal the sum of their proper divisors (Book IX). In some form Book VII stems from Theaetetus and Book VIII from Archytas.</p><!--[P18]--><span class="marker p18"></span><!--[AM18]--><span class="marker AM18 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD18]--><span class="marker MOD18 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">Book X presents a theory of irrational lines and derives from the work of Theaetetus and Eudoxus. The remaining books treat the geometry of solids. Book XI sets out results on solid figures <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="analogous" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/analogous" data-type="MW">analogous</a> to those for planes in Books I and VI; Book XII proves theorems on the ratios of circles, the ratios of spheres, and the volumes of pyramids and cones; Book XIII shows how to inscribe the five regular solids—known as the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Platonic-solid" class="md-crosslink">Platonic solids</a>—in a given <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/sphere" class="md-crosslink autoxref">sphere</a> (compare the constructions of plane figures in Book IV). The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/measurement" class="md-crosslink autoxref">measurement</a> of curved figures in Book XII is inferred from that of <span id="ref536091"></span>rectilinear figures; for a particular curved figure, a sequence of rectilinear figures is considered in which succeeding figures in the sequence become continually closer to the curved figure; the particular method used by Euclid <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="derives" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/derives" data-type="EB">derives</a> from Eudoxus.

Doubtless, Euclid must be credited with particular aspects of this work, certainly with its editing as a comprehensive whole. But it is not possible to identify for certain even a single one of its results as having been his discovery. Other, more advanced fields, though not touched on in the <em>Elements</em>, were already being vigorously studied in Euclid’s time, in some cases by Euclid himself. For these fields his textbook, true to its name, provides the <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="appropriate" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/appropriate" data-type="EB">appropriate</a> “elementary” introduction.</p><!--[P20]--><span class="marker p20"></span><!--[AM20]--><span class="marker AM20 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD20]--><span class="marker MOD20 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">One such field is the study of geometric <span id="ref536092"></span>constructions. Euclid, like geometers in the generation before him, divided mathematical propositions into two kinds: “theorems” and “<span id="ref536094"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/problem" class="md-crosslink">problems</a>.” A <span id="ref536093"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/theorem" class="md-crosslink">theorem</a> makes the claim that all terms of a certain description have a specified property; a problem seeks the construction of a term that is to have a specified property. In the <em>Elements</em> all the problems are constructible on the basis of three stated <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="postulates" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/postulates" data-type="EB">postulates</a>: that a line can be constructed by joining two given points, that a given line segment can be extended in a line indefinitely, and that a circle can be constructed with a given point as centre and a given line segment as radius. These postulates in effect restricted the constructions to the use of the so-called <span id="ref536095"></span>Euclidean tools—i.e., a compass and a straightedge or unmarked ruler.</p><!--[P21]--><span class="marker p21"></span><!--[AM21]--><span class="marker AM21 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD21]--><span class="marker MOD21 mod-inline"></span></section> </section></section><!--[END-OF-CONTENT]--><span class="marker end-of-content"></span><!--[AFTER-ARTICLE]--><span class="marker after-article"></span></div>
