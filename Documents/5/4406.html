Each biome and habitat comes with its own selection of flora and fauna, and it may include physical features such as canyons, volcanoes, rivers, or caves. Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest. Shifting trends in human migration have resulted in a human geography that is profoundly different from that of centuries ago.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg","altText":"Geography & Travel","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg"}},{"id":3000,"title":"Health & Medicine","urlTitle":"Health-Medicine","description":"The study of the human mind and body, how these function, and how they interact—not only with each other but also with their environment—has been of utmost importance in ensuring human well-being.

The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale.

The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next? Why do heavy objects tend to fall downwards when dropped? How are birds able to fly (and why can’t I do the same?)? Human beings have long been curious about the world in which we live, striving to identify connections among the phenomenons we witness and to understand how it all works. The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science. The modern-day sciences cover a vast range of fields, including biology, chemistry, meteorology, astronomy, physics, and much more.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg","altText":"Science","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/86/193986-050-7B2DBB6A/ball-and-stick-model-structure-atoms.jpg"}},{"id":4000,"title":"Sports & Recreation","urlTitle":"Sports-Recreation","description":"Physical contests and recreational games have long played a part in human society. In both team and solo sports, the human body has been pushed to its limits in the name of improving athletic performance and in order to break record upon record. The ancient Olympic Games are an early example of the contests in which humans have engaged to showcase physical prowess. In modern times, sports and games have evolved into a lucrative and competitive industry, while other leisure activities, such as card and video games, can be competitive or just serve as a way to unwind or socialize.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg","altText":"Sports & Recreation","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg"}},{"id":2000,"title":"Technology","urlTitle":"Technology","description":"Humankind has long striven to improve its living conditions through the development of tools, instruments, and transportation and communications systems, all with the goal of making our lives easier, more productive and—why not?—more fun, too.

To the general public, however, he was best known as a campaigner for peace and as a popular writer on social, political, and <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="moral" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/moral" data-type="MW">moral</a> subjects. During a long, productive, and often turbulent life, he published more than 70 books and about 2,000 articles, married four times, became involved in innumerable public controversies, and was honoured and reviled in almost equal measure throughout the world. Russell’s article on the philosophical consequences of relativity appeared in the 13th edition of the <em><span id="ref1085463"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Encyclopaedia-Britannica-English-language-reference-work" class="md-crosslink">Encyclopædia Britannica</a></em>.</p><!--[P1]--><span class="marker p1"></span><!--[AM1]--><span class="marker AM1 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD1]--><span class="marker MOD1 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">Russell was born in Ravenscroft, the country home of his parents, Lord and Lady Amberley.

By the time he was age six, his sister, Rachel, his parents, and his grandfather had all died, and he and Frank were left in the care of their grandmother, Countess Russell. Though Frank was sent to Winchester School, Bertrand was educated privately at home, and his childhood, to his later great regret, was spent largely in isolation from other children. Intellectually <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="precocious" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/precocious" data-type="MW">precocious</a>, he became absorbed in mathematics from an early age and found the experience of learning <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Euclidean-geometry" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Euclidean geometry</a> at the age of 11 “as dazzling as first love,” because it introduced him to the intoxicating possibility of certain, demonstrable knowledge. This led him to imagine that all knowledge might be provided with such secure foundations, a hope that lay at the very heart of his motivations as a philosopher. His earliest philosophical work was written during his adolescence and records the skeptical doubts that led him to abandon the Christian <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/faith" class="md-crosslink autoxref">faith</a> in which he had been brought up by his grandmother.</p><!--[P3]--><span class="marker p3"></span><!--[AM3]--><span class="marker AM3 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD3]--><span class="marker MOD3 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">In 1890 Russell’s isolation came to an end when he entered <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Trinity-College-Hartford-Connecticut" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Trinity College</a>, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/University-of-Cambridge" class="md-crosslink autoxref">University of Cambridge</a>, to study mathematics.

Inspired by his discussions with this group, Russell abandoned mathematics for philosophy and won a fellowship at Trinity on the strength of a thesis entitled <em>An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry,</em> a revised version of which was published as his first philosophical book in 1897. Following Kant’s <em><span id="ref823486"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Critique-of-Pure-Reason" class="md-crosslink">Critique of Pure Reason</a></em> (1781, 1787), this work presented a sophisticated idealist theory that viewed geometry as a description of the structure of spatial <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="intuition" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intuition" data-type="MW">intuition</a>.</p><!--[P4]--><span class="marker p4"></span><!--[AM4]--><span class="marker AM4 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD4]--><span class="marker MOD4 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">In 1896 Russell published his first political work, <em><span id="ref823489"></span>German Social Democracy.</em> Though sympathetic to the reformist aims of the German socialist movement, it included some trenchant and farsighted <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="criticisms" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/criticisms" data-type="MW">criticisms</a> of Marxist <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="dogmas" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dogmas" data-type="MW">dogmas</a>. The book was written partly as the outcome of a visit to Berlin in 1895 with his first wife, Alys Pearsall Smith, whom he had married the previous year. In Berlin, Russell formulated an ambitious scheme of writing two series of books, one on the philosophy of the sciences, the other on social and political questions. “At last,” as he later put it, “I would achieve a Hegelian synthesis in an encyclopaedic work dealing equally with theory and practice.” He did, in fact, come to write on all the subjects he intended, but not in the form that he <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="envisaged" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/envisaged" data-type="MW">envisaged</a>.

Moore</a>. A much greater influence on his <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/thought" class="md-crosslink autoxref">thought</a> at this time, however, was a group of German mathematicians that included <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Karl-Weierstrass" class="md-crosslink">Karl Weierstrass</a>, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Georg-Ferdinand-Ludwig-Philipp-Cantor" class="md-crosslink">Georg Cantor</a>, and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Dedekind" class="md-crosslink">Richard Dedekind</a>, whose work was aimed at providing mathematics with a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/set-mathematics-and-logic" class="md-crosslink autoxref">set</a> of logically rigorous foundations. For Russell, their success in this endeavour was of enormous philosophical as well as mathematical significance; indeed, he described it as “the greatest triumph of which our age has to boast.” After becoming acquainted with this body of work, Russell abandoned all vestiges of his earlier idealism and adopted the view, which he was to hold for the rest of his life, that analysis rather than synthesis was the surest method of philosophy and that therefore all the grand system building of previous philosophers was misconceived. In arguing for this view with passion and <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="acuity" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acuity" data-type="MW">acuity</a>, Russell exerted a profound influence on the entire tradition of English-speaking <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/analytic-philosophy" class="md-crosslink autoxref">analytic philosophy</a>, <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="bequeathing" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bequeathing" data-type="MW">bequeathing</a> to it its characteristic style, method, and tone.</p><!--[P6]--><span class="marker p6"></span><!--[AM6]--><span class="marker AM6 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD6]--><span class="marker MOD6 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">Inspired by the work of the mathematicians whom he so greatly admired, Russell conceived the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/idea" class="md-crosslink autoxref">idea</a> of demonstrating that mathematics not only had logically rigorous foundations but also that it was in its entirety nothing but logic. The philosophical case for this point of view—subsequently known as <span id="ref823491"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/logicism" class="md-crosslink">logicism</a>—was stated at length in <em><span id="ref823467"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Principles-of-Mathematics" class="md-crosslink">The Principles of Mathematics</a></em> (1903). There Russell argued that the whole of mathematics could be derived from a few simple axioms that made no use of specifically mathematical notions, such as number and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/square-root" class="md-crosslink autoxref">square root</a>, but were rather <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="confined" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/confined" data-type="EB">confined</a> to purely logical notions, such as proposition and class. In this way not only could the truths of mathematics be shown to be immune from doubt, they could also be freed from any taint of subjectivity, such as the subjectivity involved in Russell’s earlier Kantian view that geometry describes the structure of spatial intuition. Near the end of his work on <em>The Principles of Mathematics,</em> Russell discovered that he had been anticipated in his logicist philosophy of mathematics by the German mathematician <span id="ref823492"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gottlob-Frege" class="md-crosslink">Gottlob Frege</a>, whose book <em><span id="ref823493"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Foundations-of-Arithmetic" class="md-crosslink">The Foundations of Arithmetic</a></em> (1884) contained, as Russell put it, “many things…which I believed I had invented.” Russell quickly added an appendix to his book that discussed Frege’s work, acknowledged Frege’s earlier discoveries, and explained the differences in their respective understandings of the nature of logic.</p><!--[P7]--><span class="marker p7"></span><!--[AM7]--><span class="marker AM7 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD7]--><span class="marker MOD7 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">The tragedy of Russell’s <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="intellectual" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intellectual" data-type="MW">intellectual</a> life is that the deeper he thought about logic, the more his exalted <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="conception" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conception" data-type="MW">conception</a> of its significance came under threat. He himself described his philosophical development after <em>The Principles of Mathematics</em> as a “retreat from Pythagoras.” The first step in this retreat was his discovery of a contradiction—now known as <span id="ref823495"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Russells-paradox" class="md-crosslink">Russell’s Paradox</a>—at the very heart of the system of logic upon which he had hoped to build the whole of mathematics. The contradiction arises from the following considerations: Some classes are members of themselves (e.g., the class of all classes), and some are not (e.g., the class of all men), so we ought to be able to construct the class of all classes that are not members of themselves. But now, if we ask of this class “Is it a member of itself?” we become enmeshed in a contradiction. If it is, then it is not, and if it is not, then it is. This is rather like defining the village barber as “the man who shaves all those who do not shave themselves” and then asking whether the barber shaves himself or not.</p><!--[P8]--><span class="marker p8"></span><!--[AM8]--><span class="marker AM8 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD8]--><span class="marker MOD8 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">At first this <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="paradox" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/paradox" data-type="MW">paradox</a> seemed trivial, but the more Russell reflected upon it, the deeper the problem seemed, and eventually he was persuaded that there was something fundamentally wrong with the notion of class as he had understood it in <em>The Principles of Mathematics.</em> Frege saw the depth of the problem immediately. When Russell wrote to him to tell him of the paradox, Frege replied, “arithmetic totters.” The foundation upon which Frege and Russell had hoped to build mathematics had, it seemed, collapsed. Whereas Frege sank into a deep depression, Russell set about repairing the damage by attempting to construct a theory of logic <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="immune" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/immune" data-type="EB">immune</a> to the paradox. Like a malignant cancerous growth, however, the contradiction reappeared in different guises whenever Russell thought that he had eliminated it.</p><!--[P9]--><span class="marker p9"></span><!--[AM9]--><span class="marker AM9 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD9]--><span class="marker MOD9 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">Eventually, Russell’s attempts to overcome the paradox resulted in a complete transformation of his scheme of logic, as he added one refinement after another to the basic theory. In the process, important elements of his “Pythagorean” view of logic were abandoned. In particular, Russell came to the conclusion that there were no such things as classes and propositions and that therefore, whatever logic was, it was not the study of them. In their place he substituted a bewilderingly complex theory known as the ramified <span id="ref823497"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/theory-of-types-logic" class="md-crosslink">theory of types</a>, which, though it successfully avoided contradictions such as Russell’s Paradox, was (and remains) extraordinarily difficult to understand. By the time he and his collaborator, <span id="ref823473"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alfred-North-Whitehead" class="md-crosslink">Alfred North Whitehead</a>, had finished the three volumes of <em><span id="ref823472"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Principia-Mathematica" class="md-crosslink">Principia Mathematica</a></em> (1910–13), the theory of types and other <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="innovations" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/innovations" data-type="MW">innovations</a> to the basic logical system had made it unmanageably complicated. Very few people, whether philosophers or mathematicians, have made the gargantuan effort required to master the details of this monumental work. It is nevertheless rightly regarded as one of the great intellectual achievements of the 20th century.</p><!--[P10]--><span class="marker p10"></span><!--[AM10]--><span class="marker AM10 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD10]--><span class="marker MOD10 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph"><em>Principia Mathematica</em> is a herculean attempt to demonstrate mathematically what <em>The Principles of Mathematics</em> had argued for philosophically, namely that mathematics is a branch of logic. The validity of the individual formal proofs that make up the bulk of its three volumes has gone largely unchallenged, but the philosophical significance of the work as a whole is still a matter of debate. Does it demonstrate that mathematics is logic? Only if one regards the theory of types as a logical truth, and about that there is much more room for doubt than there was about the trivial truisms upon which Russell had originally intended to build mathematics. Moreover, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kurt-Godel" class="md-crosslink">Kurt Gödel</a>’s <span id="ref823498"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Godels-first-incompleteness-theorem" class="md-crosslink">first incompleteness theorem</a> (1931) proves that there cannot be a single logical theory from which the whole of mathematics is derivable: all consistent theories of arithmetic are necessarily incomplete. <em>Principia Mathematica</em> cannot, however, be dismissed as nothing more than a heroic failure. Its influence on the development of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/formal-logic" class="md-crosslink autoxref">mathematical logic</a> and the philosophy of mathematics has been immense.</p><!--[P11]--><span class="marker p11"></span><!--[AM11]--><span class="marker AM11 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD11]--><span class="marker MOD11 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">Despite their differences, Russell and Frege were alike in taking an essentially <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="Platonic" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Platonic" data-type="MW">Platonic</a> view of logic. Indeed, the passion with which Russell pursued the project of deriving mathematics from logic owed a great deal to what he would later somewhat scornfully describe as a “kind of mathematical mysticism.” As he put it in his more disillusioned <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/old-age" class="md-crosslink autoxref">old age</a>, “I disliked the real world and sought refuge in a timeless world, without change or decay or the will-o’-the-wisp of progress.” Russell, like Pythagoras and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Plato" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Plato</a> before him, believed that there existed a realm of truth that, unlike the messy <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="contingencies" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/contingencies" data-type="MW">contingencies</a> of the everyday world of sense-experience, was immutable and eternal. This realm was accessible only to reason, and knowledge of it, once attained, was not tentative or corrigible but certain and irrefutable. Logic, for Russell, was the means by which one gained access to this realm, and thus the pursuit of logic was, for him, the highest and noblest enterprise life had to offer.</p><!--[P12]--><span class="marker p12"></span><!--[AM12]--><span class="marker AM12 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD12]--><span class="marker MOD12 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">In philosophy the greatest impact of <em>Principia Mathematica</em> has been through its so-called <span id="ref823504"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/theory-of-descriptions" class="md-crosslink">theory of descriptions</a>. This method of analysis, first introduced by Russell in his article “On Denoting” (1905), translates propositions containing definite descriptions (e.g., “the present king of France”) into expressions that do not—the purpose being to remove the logical awkwardness of appearing to refer to things (such as the present king of France) that do not exist. Originally developed by Russell as part of his efforts to overcome the <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="contradictions" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/contradictions" data-type="EB">contradictions</a> in his theory of logic, this method of analysis has since become widely influential even among philosophers with no specific interest in mathematics. The general idea at the root of Russell’s theory of descriptions—that the grammatical structures of ordinary <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/language" class="md-crosslink autoxref">language</a> are distinct from, and often conceal, the true “logical forms” of expressions—has become his most enduring contribution to philosophy.</p><!--[P13]--><span class="marker p13"></span><!--[AM13]--><span class="marker AM13 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD13]--><span class="marker MOD13 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">Russell later said that his <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/mind" class="md-crosslink autoxref">mind</a> never fully recovered from the strain of writing <em>Principia Mathematica,</em> and he never again worked on logic with quite the same intensity. In 1918 he wrote <em>Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy,</em> which was intended as a popularization of <em>Principia,</em> but, apart from this, his philosophical work tended to be on epistemology rather than logic. In 1914, in <em>Our Knowledge of the External World,</em> Russell argued that the world is “constructed” out of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/sense-data" class="md-crosslink autoxref">sense-data</a>, an idea that he refined in <em>The Philosophy of <span id="ref823468"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Logical-Atomism" class="md-crosslink">Logical Atomism</a></em> (1918–19). In <em><span id="ref823470"></span>The Analysis of Mind</em> (1921) and <em><span id="ref823469"></span>The Analysis of Matter</em> (1927), he abandoned this <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="notion" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/notion" data-type="EB">notion</a> in favour of what he called <span id="ref823506"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/neutral-monism" class="md-crosslink">neutral monism</a>, the view that the “ultimate stuff” of the world is neither mental nor physical but something “neutral” between the two. Although treated with respect, these works had markedly less impact upon subsequent philosophers than his early works in logic and the philosophy of mathematics, and they are generally regarded as inferior by comparison.</p><!--[P14]--><span class="marker p14"></span><!--[AM14]--><span class="marker AM14 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD14]--><span class="marker MOD14 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">Connected with the change in his intellectual direction after the completion of <em>Principia</em> was a profound change in his personal life. Throughout the years that he worked single-mindedly on logic, Russell’s private life was bleak and joyless. He had fallen out of love with his first wife, Alys, though he continued to live with her. In 1911, however, he fell passionately in love with <span id="ref823474"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lady-Ottoline-Violet-Anne-Morrell" class="md-crosslink">Lady Ottoline Morrell</a>. Doomed from the start (because Morrell had no <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/intention-logic" class="md-crosslink autoxref">intention</a> of leaving her husband), this love nevertheless transformed Russell’s entire life. He left Alys and began to hope that he might, after all, find fulfillment in romance. Partly under Morrell’s influence, he also largely lost interest in technical philosophy and began to write in a different, more accessible style. Through writing a best-selling introductory survey called <em><span id="ref823507"></span>The Problems of Philosophy</em> (1911), Russell discovered that he had a gift for writing on difficult subjects for lay readers, and he began increasingly to address his work to them rather than to the tiny handful of people capable of understanding <em>Principia Mathematica.</em></p><!--[P15]--><span class="marker p15"></span><!--[AM15]--><span class="marker AM15 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD15]--><span class="marker MOD15 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">In the same year that he began his affair with Morrell, Russell met <span id="ref823476"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ludwig-Wittgenstein" class="md-crosslink">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>, a brilliant young Austrian who arrived at Cambridge to study logic with Russell. Fired with intense enthusiasm for the subject, Wittgenstein made great progress, and within a year Russell began to look to him to provide the next big step in philosophy and to <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="defer" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/defer" data-type="EB">defer</a> to him on questions of logic. However, Wittgenstein’s own work, eventually published in 1921 as <em>Logisch-philosophische Abhandlung</em> (<em><span id="ref823477"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus" class="md-crosslink">Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</a>,</em> 1922), undermined the entire approach to logic that had inspired Russell’s great contributions to the philosophy of mathematics. It persuaded Russell that there were no “truths” of logic at all, that logic consisted entirely of tautologies, the truth of which was not guaranteed by eternal facts in the Platonic realm of ideas but lay, rather, simply in the nature of language. This was to be the final step in the retreat from Pythagoras and a further <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="incentive" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/incentive" data-type="EB">incentive</a> for Russell to abandon technical philosophy in favour of other pursuits.</p><!--[P16]--><span class="marker p16"></span><!--[AM16]--><span class="marker AM16 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD16]--><span class="marker MOD16 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">During <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-I" class="md-crosslink autoxref">World War I</a> Russell was for a while a full-time political agitator, campaigning for peace and against conscription. His activities attracted the attention of the British authorities, who regarded him as subversive. He was twice taken to court, the second time to receive a sentence of six months in prison, which he served at the end of the war. In 1916, as a result of his antiwar campaigning, Russell was dismissed from his lectureship at Trinity College. Although Trinity offered to rehire him after the war, he ultimately turned down the offer, preferring instead to pursue a career as a journalist and freelance writer. The war had had a profound effect on Russell’s political views, causing him to abandon his inherited <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/liberalism" class="md-crosslink autoxref">liberalism</a> and to adopt a thorough-going <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/socialism" class="md-crosslink autoxref">socialism</a>, which he espoused in a series of books including <em>Principles of Social Reconstruction</em> (1916), <em>Roads to Freedom</em> (1918), and <em>The Prospects of Industrial Civilization</em> (1923).

In the interwar years Russell and Dora acquired a reputation as leaders of a progressive socialist movement that was stridently anticlerical, openly defiant of conventional sexual <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="morality" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/morality" data-type="MW">morality</a>, and dedicated to educational reform. Russell’s published work during this period consists mainly of journalism and popular books written in support of these causes. Many of these books—such as <em>On Education</em> (1926), <em>Marriage and Morals</em> (1929), and <em>The Conquest of Happiness</em> (1930)—enjoyed large sales and helped establish Russell in the eyes of the general public as a philosopher with important things to say about the moral, political, and social issues of the day. His public lecture “Why I Am Not a Christian,” delivered in 1927 and printed many times, became a popular locus classicus of atheistic <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/rationalism" class="md-crosslink autoxref">rationalism</a>. In 1927 Russell and Dora set up their own school, Beacon Hill, as a pioneering experiment in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/elementary-education" class="md-crosslink autoxref">primary education</a>. To pay for it, Russell undertook a few lucrative but exhausting lecture tours of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States" class="md-crosslink autoxref">United States</a>.</p><!--[P18]--><span class="marker p18"></span><!--[AM18]--><span class="marker AM18 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD18]--><span class="marker MOD18 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">During these years Russell’s second marriage came under increasing strain, partly because of overwork but chiefly because Dora chose to have two children with another man and insisted on raising them alongside John and Kate. In 1932 Russell left Dora for Patricia (“Peter”) Spence, a young <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/University-of-Oxford" class="md-crosslink autoxref">University of Oxford</a> undergraduate, and for the next three years his life was dominated by an extraordinarily <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="acrimonious" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acrimonious" data-type="MW">acrimonious</a> and complicated divorce from Dora, which was finally granted in 1935. In the following year he married Spence, and in 1937 they had a son, Conrad. Worn out by years of frenetic public activity and desiring, at this comparatively late stage in his life (he was then age 66), to return to academic philosophy, Russell gained a teaching post at the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/University-of-Chicago" class="md-crosslink autoxref">University of Chicago</a>. From 1938 to 1944 Russell lived in the United States, where he taught at Chicago and the University of California at Los Angeles, but he was prevented from taking a post at the City College of New York because of objections to his views on sex and marriage. On the brink of financial ruin, he secured a job teaching the history of philosophy at the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Barnes-Foundation" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Barnes Foundation</a> in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Philadelphia" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Philadelphia</a>.

During this period Russell, for once in his life, found favour with the authorities, and he received many official <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="tributes" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/tributes" data-type="EB">tributes</a>, including the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Order-of-Merit" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Order of Merit</a> in 1949 and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950. His private life, however, remained as turbulent as ever, and he left his third wife in 1949. For a while he shared a house in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Richmond-upon-Thames" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Richmond upon Thames</a>, London, with the family of his son John and, forsaking both philosophy and politics, dedicated himself to writing short stories.
