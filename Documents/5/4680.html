            "description": "\u0022Democracies must step in and make new laws,\u0022 the whistleblower told lawmakers in the European Parliament.",
            "articleBody": "Frances Haugen, the Facebook whistleblower who has exposed the company's alleged inaction to fight misinformation and hate speech, has urged European lawmakers to seize a \u0022once-in-a-generation opportunity\u0022 to align technology and democracy and create a safer online world. Facebook can no longer be \u0022the judge, the jury, the prosecutor and the witness\u0022 of the digital space, Haugen told MEPs in a hearing held in Brussels. \u0022Democracies must step in and make new laws.\u0022 The data engineer accused her former employer of undermining the health, safety and integrity of communities around the world due to its systematic failure to curb fake news and hate speech. \u0022I am here today because I believe that Facebook's products harm children, stoke division, weaken our democracy and much more,\u0022 she said in her opening statement. Huagen said the company has the tools to make Facebook safer but won't take reforming action because doing so would result in fewer profits. This refusal to change course, she added, has already resulted in \u0022actual violence\u0022 and will continue until new legislation is introduced. \u0022It doesn't have to be this way,\u0022 she remarked. \u0022We are here today because of deliberate choices Facebook has made.\u0022 The whistleblower described Facebook as an impenetrable \u0022profit-generating machine\u0022 that makes it impossible for public authorities, experts, academics and even its own shareholders to access its data and understand how the company really works and influences social coexistence. \u0022Almost no one outside Facebook knows what's happening inside Facebook,\u0022 she told lawmakers. \u0022No one can understand Facebook's destructive choices better than Facebook.\u0022 The California-based multinational, she noted, has known \u0022at least\u0022 since 2018 that European political parties exploit polarising content to reach citizens at a faster pace and and at a larger scale. Online campaigns based on divisive messages are \u0022five to ten times\u0022 cheaper, she said. Facebook denies Haugen's accusations and argues her version of events is inaccurate and nonsensical. In the midst of the PR scandal, the company  has rebranded itself  as Meta to focus on the nascent metaverse, an under-construction virtual reality where people could meet, work and play. The whistleblower said the abrupt shift to the metaverse reflects the multinational's habit to move on to new projects instead of tackling the problems caused by its current range of products. 'Potential to become global gold standard' Haugen's visit to Brussels is part of a wider European tour that began in the United Kingdom and then continued in Germany. Since revealing her identity, she has become a strong advocate for state regulation to rein in the power excesses of Big Tech. During the hearing, which took over three hours, MEPs asked the whistleblower for her opinion about the Digital Services Act (DSA), a world-first draft law to govern the digital economy. Unveiled in December 2020 by the European Commission, the DSA  is a rulebook  to protect the fundamental rights of consumers and increase the transparency and accountability of online platforms. The legislation features a set of obligations for Internet providers, hosting services (like cloud), online platforms (such as app stores and social media) and the so-called \u0022very large online platforms\u0022, those who reach more than 10% of the EU's population. Facebook has over 250 million users in the bloc. Due to its size, audience and profits, this last category is the one subject to the longest list of rules and obligations, which include abiding by codes of conduct, sharing data with public authorities, disclosing algorithms used for recommendations and empowering users to report illegal content. Haugen spoke positively about the proposed DSA and said it has \u0022the potential to become the global gold standard\u0022 and inspire other countries, including her native America, to follow suit. \u0022There is a lot at stake here. You have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create new rules for our online world,\u0022 she told MEPs. \u0022A safer, more enjoyable social media is possible.\u0022 She urged lawmakers to guarantee the law's enforcement is firm and avoid possible loopholes that can shield Facebook from true accountability. Among her suggestions was to narrow as much as possible the exception for trade secrets which, if too broad, the company could exploit to deny access to its data and algorithms. Haugen underlined the need to force online platforms to release risk assessments to the public and therefore allow citizens to make better-informed consumer choices. \u0022You can't have a free market if people don't know what they're buying,\u0022 she said, claiming that Facebook has hidden its internal data \u0022because it's bad\u0022. The DSA's scope, she recommended, must go beyond illegal content and cover all content that violates the platform's terms and conditions. Lawmakers and member states are currently debating and negotiating the draft law, which is expected to be passed in the second half of 2022. \u0022The devil is in the details,\u0022 she cautioned. Another recurrent topic during the Q&A session was the question of linguistic diversity. Haugen believes Facebook's content moderation only works in American English \u2013 the language the system was developed in \u2013 and is vastly inefficient in other countries and languages, even in British English. She said linguistically diverse places are the most vulnerable to harmful content and asked European lawmakers to use their draft legislation to impose \u0022language-neutral solutions\u0022 on Facebook. \u0022If you get the DSA right for your linguistically and ethnically diverse 450 million EU citizens, you can create a game-changer for the world,\u0022 Haugen said. \u0022I believe we still have time to act and we must act now.\u0022 Prior to the hearing, Haugen met Thierry Breton, the European Commissioner for the internal market, and Christel Schaldemose, the MEP who is serving as rapporteur for the DSA file. Who is Frances Haugen? A former Facebook employee, Frances Haugen rose to global prominence in early October when  she appeared on a prime-time show  on American television and claimed the company consistently chooses to prioritise its profitability and growth to the detriment of the well-being of its millions of users around the world. Haugen, who worked in the company's civic integrity department, leaked thousands of sensitive and unheard-of documents to The Wall Street Journal and the Securities and Exchange Commission to back up her claims. The data engineer has accused Facebook of fostering a business model that promotes hate speech and misinformation, damages democracy and sows social division through the uncontrolled spread of polarising -- but highly profitable -- content. She has spoken about Instagram's negative impact on teenage mental health and Facebook's enabling role in the ethnic violence in Ethiopia and Myanmar. She also said the tech giant misled investors by supposedly painting a deceptive picture of its efforts to curb misinformation.  More recently , she called on the founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to resign. \u0022The thing I saw over and over again was that there were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook,\u0022 Haugen told CBS's 60 Minutes.",

This refusal to change course, she added, has already resulted in "actual violence" and will continue until new legislation is introduced.</p><p>"It doesn't have to be this way," she remarked.

"No one can understand Facebook's destructive choices better than Facebook."</p><p>The California-based multinational, she noted, has known "at least" since 2018 that European political parties exploit polarising content to reach citizens at a faster pace and and at a larger scale. Online campaigns based on divisive messages are "five to ten times" cheaper, she said.</p><p>Facebook denies Haugen's accusations and argues her version of events is inaccurate and nonsensical. In the midst of the PR scandal, the company <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-name-to-meta-as-the-company-expands-into-the-metaverse"><strong>has rebranded itself</strong></a> as Meta to focus on the nascent metaverse, an under-construction virtual reality where people could meet, work and play.</p><p>The whistleblower said the abrupt shift to the metaverse reflects the multinational's habit to move on to new projects instead of tackling the problems caused by its current range of products.</p><div class="ads small-12 column text-center show-for-small-only u-show-for-small-only"><div class="enw-MPU "><div data-ad-name="adzone-mpu" data-ad-index="1" class="enw-MPU__img advertising js-adzone"></div></div></div><h2><strong>'Potential to become global gold standard'</strong></h2><p>Haugen's visit to Brussels is part of a wider European tour that began in the United Kingdom and then continued in Germany. Since revealing her identity, she has become a strong advocate for state regulation to rein in the power excesses of Big Tech.</p><p>During the hearing, which took over three hours, MEPs asked the whistleblower for her opinion about the Digital Services Act (DSA), a world-first draft law to govern the digital economy.</p><p>Unveiled in December 2020 by the European Commission, the DSA <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act-ensuring-safe-and-accountable-online-environment_en"><strong>is a rulebook</strong></a> to protect the fundamental rights of consumers and increase the transparency and accountability of online platforms.</p><p>The legislation features a set of obligations for Internet providers, hosting services (like cloud), online platforms (such as app stores and social media) and the so-called "very large online platforms", those who reach more than 10% of the EU's population. Facebook has over 250 million users in the bloc.</p><p>Due to its size, audience and profits, this last category is the one subject to the longest list of rules and obligations, which include abiding by codes of conduct, sharing data with public authorities, disclosing algorithms used for recommendations and empowering users to report illegal content.</p><div class="ads small-12 column text-center show-for-small-only u-show-for-small-only"><div class="enw-MPU "><div data-ad-name="adzone-mpu" data-ad-index="2" class="enw-MPU__img advertising js-adzone"></div></div></div><p>Haugen spoke positively about the proposed DSA and said it has "the potential to become the global gold standard" and inspire other countries, including her native America, to follow suit.</p><p>"There is a lot at stake here. You have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create new rules for our online world," she told MEPs.</p><p>"A safer, more enjoyable social media is possible."</p><p>She urged lawmakers to guarantee the law's enforcement is firm and avoid possible loopholes that can shield Facebook from true accountability.</p><p>Among her suggestions was to narrow as much as possible the exception for trade secrets which, if too broad, the company could exploit to deny access to its data and algorithms.</p><div class="ads small-12 column text-center show-for-small-only u-show-for-small-only"><div class="enw-MPU "><div data-ad-name="adzone-mpu" data-ad-index="3" class="enw-MPU__img advertising js-adzone"></div></div></div><p>Haugen underlined the need to force online platforms to release risk assessments to the public and therefore allow citizens to make better-informed consumer choices.</p><p>"You can't have a free market if people don't know what they're buying," she said, claiming that Facebook has hidden its internal data "because it's bad".</p><p>The DSA's scope, she recommended, must go beyond illegal content and cover all content that violates the platform's terms and conditions.</p><p>Lawmakers and member states are currently debating and negotiating the draft law, which is expected to be passed in the second half of 2022.</p><p>"The devil is in the details," she cautioned.</p><p>Another recurrent topic during the Q&amp;A session was the question of linguistic diversity. Haugen believes Facebook's content moderation only works in American English &ndash; the language the system was developed in &ndash; and is vastly inefficient in other countries and languages, even in British English.</p><p>She said linguistically diverse places are the most vulnerable to harmful content and asked European lawmakers to use their draft legislation to impose "language-neutral solutions" on Facebook.</p><p>"If you get the DSA right for your linguistically and ethnically diverse 450 million EU citizens, you can create a game-changer for the world," Haugen said.</p><p>"I believe we still have time to act and we must act now."</p><p>Prior to the hearing, Haugen met Thierry Breton, the European Commissioner for the internal market, and Christel Schaldemose, the MEP who is serving as rapporteur for the DSA file.</p><div class="widget widget--type-tweet widget--size-fullwidth widget--align-center"><div class="widget__wrapper"><div class="widget__ratio widget__ratio&mdash;auto"><div class="widget__contents"><figure class="widget__figure"><div class="widget__tweet" data-tweet-id="1457691688768507911"></div></figure></div></div></div></div><h2>Who is Frances Haugen?</h2><p>A former Facebook employee, Frances Haugen rose to global prominence in early October when <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/10/04/facebook-profits-off-hate-and-that-s-why-it-won-t-change-says-whistleblower-frances-haugen"><strong>she appeared on a prime-time show</strong></a> on American television and claimed the company consistently chooses to prioritise its profitability and growth to the detriment of the well-being of its millions of users around the world.</p><p>Haugen, who worked in the company's civic integrity department, leaked thousands of sensitive and unheard-of documents to The Wall Street Journal and the Securities and Exchange Commission to back up her claims.</p><p>The data engineer has accused Facebook of fostering a business model that promotes hate speech and misinformation, damages democracy and sows social division through the uncontrolled spread of polarising -- but highly profitable -- content.</p><p>She has spoken about Instagram's negative impact on teenage mental health and Facebook's enabling role in the ethnic violence in Ethiopia and Myanmar. She also said the tech giant misled investors by supposedly painting a deceptive picture of its efforts to curb misinformation. <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/11/02/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-says-mark-zuckerberg-should-resign-to-make-the-platf"><strong>More recently</strong></a>, she called on the founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to resign.</p><p>"The thing I saw over and over again was that there were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook," Haugen told CBS's 60 Minutes.</p></div></div></section><footer><section class="c-article-footer__section u-show-for-small-only js-footer-social-widget u-margin-top-4 u-padding-top-5"><div class="u-margin-bottom-medium-3 js-sticky-social-widget"><div class="c-social-share t-social-share--blue js-social-share "><p class="c-social-share__title">Share this article</p><ul class="c-social-share__list js-social-share-list"><li class="c-social-share__list--embed js-tooltip c-tooltip"><img class="c-social-share__icon"
