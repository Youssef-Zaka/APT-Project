These are semi-permanent competitions that are meant to be used by new users just getting their foot in the door in the field of machine learning. They offer no prizes or points.

Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.

These are competitions which often provide relatively simple machine learning tasks, and are similarly targeted at newcomers or Kagglers interested in practicing a new type of problem in a lower-stakes setting.

Hidden among hundreds of variables in the training data was a variable named PROSSURG. It turned out this represented whether the patient had received prostate surgery, an incredibly predictive but out-of-scope value.\u003C/p\u003E\n    \u003Cp\u003EThe resulting model was highly predictive of whether the patient had prostate cancer but was useless for making predictions on new patients.\u003C/p\u003E\n    \u003Cp\u003EThis is an extreme example - many more instances of leakage occur in subtle and hard-to-detect ways. An early Kaggle competition, Link Prediction for Social Networks, makes a good case study in this.\u003C/p\u003E\n    \u003Cp\u003EThere was a sampling error in the script that created that dataset for the competition: a \u0026gt; sign instead of a \u0026gt;= sign meant that, when a candidate edge pair had a certain property, the edge pair was guaranteed to be true. A team exploited this leakage to take second in the competition.\u003C/p\u003E\n    \u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, the winning team won not by using the best machine-learned model, but by scraping the underlying true social network and then defeated anonymization of the nodes with a very clever methodology.\u003C/p\u003E\n    \u003Cp\u003EOutside of Kaggle, we\u2019ve heard war stories of models with leakage running in production systems for years before the bugs in the data creation or model training scripts were detected.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n    \u003Ch4 id=\u0022leakage-in-competitions\u0022\u003ELeakage in Competitions\u003C/h4\u003E\n    \u003Cp\u003ELeakage is especially challenging in machine learning competitions. In normal situations, leaked information is typically only used accidentally. But in competitions, participants often find and intentionally exploit leakage where it is present.\u003C/p\u003E\n    \u003Cp\u003EParticipants may also leverage external data sources to provide more information on the ground truth. In fact, \u201Cthe concept of identifying and harnessing leakage has been openly addressed as one of three key aspects for winning data mining competitions\u201D (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.cs.umb.edu/~ding/history/470_670_fall_2011/papers/cs670_Tran_PreferredPaper_LeakingInDataMining.pdf\u0022\u003Esource paper\u003C/a\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\n    \u003Cp\u003EIdentifying leakage beforehand and correcting for it is an important part of improving the definition of a machine learning problem. Many forms of leakage are subtle and are best detected by trying to extract features and train state-of-the-art models on the problem. This means that there are no guarantees that competitions will launch free of leakage, especially for Research competitions (which have minimal checks on the underlying data prior to launch).\u003C/p\u003E\n    \u003Cp\u003EWhen leakage is found in a competition, there are many ways that we can address it.

It would be better for the competition, the participants, and the hosts if leakage became public knowledge when it was discovered.
