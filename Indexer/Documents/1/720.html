Except for the extent to which it was blocked by various courts, it was in effect from January 27, 2017, until March 6, 2017, when it was superseded by [[Executive Order 13780]]. Executive Order 13769 lowered the number of refugees to be admitted into the United States in 2017 to 50,000, suspended the [[United States Refugee Admissions Program|U.S. Refugee Admissions Program]] (USRAP) for 120 days, suspended the entry of [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugees]] indefinitely, directed some [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet secretaries]] to suspend entry of those whose countries do not meet adjudication standards under [[Immigration and Nationality Act|U.S. immigration law]] for 90 days, and included exceptions on a case-by-case basis. The [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) listed these countries as [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Libya]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[Syria]], and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="auto">Executive Order 13769 of January 27, 2017: Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.

The signing of the Executive Order provoked widespread [[Reactions to Executive Order 13769|condemnation and protests]] and resulted in [[legal challenges to the Trump travel ban|legal intervention against the enforcement of the order]]. Critics referred to it as a "Muslim ban," because President Trump had previously called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering America,&lt;ref>{{cite news |last1=Beckwith |first1=Ryan |title=Read Trump's Speech on the Orlando Shooting |url=https://time.com/4367120/orlando-shooting-donald-trump-transcript/ |access-date=18 May 2021 |work=Time |date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref> and because all of the affected countries had a Muslim majority, although the affected Muslims were only 12% of the global Muslim population.&lt;ref name="Muslim ban">[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41382585 US expands travel ban to include N Korea], [[BBC]] "Mr Trump's original ban was highly controversial, as it affected six majority-Muslim countries, and was widely labelled a 'Muslim ban'."&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>{{Cite web|last1=Gore|first1=D'Angelo|last2=Robertson|first2=Lori|date=2018-06-28|title=Trump's 'Travel Ban' Doesn't Affect All Muslims|url=https://www.factcheck.org/2018/06/trumps-travel-ban-doesnt-affect-all-muslims/|access-date=2021-08-29|website=FactCheck.org|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref> A nationwide [[temporary restraining order]] (TRO) was issued on February 3, 2017 in the case ''[[Washington v. Trump]]'', which was upheld by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] on February 9, 2017. Consequently, the Department of Homeland Security stopped enforcing portions of the order and the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] re-validated visas that had been previously revoked. Later, other orders (Executive Order 13780 and [[Presidential Proclamation 9645]]) were signed by President Trump and superseded Executive Order 13769. On June 26, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the third Executive Order (Presidential Proclamation 9645) and its accompanying travel ban in a [[Trump v. Hawaii|5–4 decision]], with the majority opinion being written by Chief Justice [[John Roberts]].&lt;ref>{{cite news|title=Trump's Travel Ban Is Upheld by Supreme Court|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-travel-ban.html |first1=Adam |last1=Liptak |first2=Michael D. |last2=Shear|date=June 26, 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref>

==Background==
===Statutory authorization and related prohibitions===
{{see also|Immigration to the United States}}
[[File:Visas to 7 countries in immigration ban by type and number 2016.png|right|thumb|Visas issued in 2016 for the 7 countries affected by section 3 of the executive order. Total is shown by size, and color breaks down [[Permanent residence (United States)#Types of immigration|type of visa]]&lt;ref name="Visas2016">{{cite news|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/law-and-policy/statistics/annual-reports/report-of-the-visa-office-2016.html|title=Report of the Visa Office 2016|publisher=Bureau of Consular Affairs, U.S. Department of State|access-date=February 4, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204021432/https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/law-and-policy/statistics/annual-reports/report-of-the-visa-office-2016.html|archive-date=February 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref>]]
Key provisions of executive orders 13769 and 13780 cite to paragraph (f) of [[Title 8 of the United States Code]] § 1182, which discusses inadmissible aliens. Paragraph (f) states: 
&lt;blockquote>Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.{{efn |{{USCSub |8 |1182 |f}}}}&lt;/blockquote>

The act that underlies this, known as the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952|Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (a.k.a. the McCarran–Walter Act)]], was amended by the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (a.k.a. the Hart−Celler Act)]], which included a provision stating

&lt;blockquote>No person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.{{efn |{{USCSub |8 |1152 |a}}}}&lt;/blockquote>

The language in the INA of 1965 is among the reasons District of Maryland [[Theodore D. Chuang|Judge Chuang]] issued a temporary restraining order blocking Section 2(c) of Executive Order 13780.&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cato.org/blog/court-rules-president-violated-1965-law-executive-order|first=David|last=Bier|publisher=[[Cato Institute]] |date=March 17, 2017|title=Court Rules the President Violated the 1965 Law with Executive Order}}&lt;/ref>

===Restrictions by the Obama administration===
In 1986, the [[Visa Waiver Program]] was initiated by President Ronald Reagan, allowing alien nationals of select countries to travel to the United States for up to 90 days without a visa, in return for reciprocal treatment of U.S. nationals. By 2016, the program had been extended to 38 countries.&lt;ref name="CBPVWPinfo">{{cite web|title=Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/visa-waiver-program/visa-waiver-program-improvement-and-terrorist-travel-prevention-act-faq|website=U.S. Customs and Border Protection|publisher=United States Department of Homeland Security|access-date=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref> In 2015, Congress passed a [[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016|Consolidated Appropriations Act]] to fund the government, and Obama signed the bill into law.

===Green-card holders===
There was some early confusion about the status of green-card holders (i.e., lawful [[permanent residence (United States)|permanent residents]]). According to the lawsuit filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota, dated February 3, the government had changed its position five times to date.&lt;ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/02/04/17-35105%20motion.pdf|title=C17-00141-JLR-- State of Washington and State of Minnesota v. Donald Trump|publisher=United States Courts for the Ninth Circuit|access-date=February 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref> Initially, on the evening of Friday January 27, the Department of Homeland Security sent out a guidance to airlines stated "lawful permanent residents are not included and may continue to travel to the USA". CNN reported that it was overruled by the White House overnight.&lt;ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/donald-trump-travel-ban/index.html|title=Inside the confusion of the Trump executive order and travel ban|author=Evan Perez |author2=Pamela Brown |author3=Kevin Liptak |publisher=CNN |access-date=February 12, 2017|author2-link=Pamela Brown (journalist)}}&lt;/ref> Early Saturday, January 28, the Department of Homeland Security's acting press secretary Gillian Christensen said in an e-mail to Reuters that the order barred green-card holders from the affected countries.&lt;ref>{{Cite news |url=http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/316670-trump-refugee-ban-bars-green-card-holders-report|title=Immigration ban includes green card holders: DHS|last=Greenwood|first=Max|date=January 28, 2017|newspaper=The Hill|access-date=February 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref> By Saturday afternoon White House officials said they would need a case-by-case waiver to return.&lt;ref name="nyt_impact">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html|title=Judge Blocks Part of Trump's Immigration Order|last1=Shear|first1=Michael D.|date=January 28, 2017 |newspaper=The New York Times |last2=Feuer|first2=Alan |access-date=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref> On Sunday White House chief of staff [[Reince Priebus]] said that green-card holders would not be prevented from returning to the United States.&lt;ref name=nyt_greencard/>

=== Dual citizens ===
There was similar confusion about whether the order affected dual citizens of a banned country and a non-banned country. The State Department said that the order did not affect U.S. citizens who also hold citizenship of one of the seven banned countries. On January 28, the State Department stated that other travelers with dual nationality of one of these countries—for example, an Iranian who also holds a Canadian passport—would not be permitted to enter. However, the [[International Air Transport Association]] told their airlines that dual nationals who hold a passport from a non-banned country would be allowed in.&lt;ref name="cnn_dual">{{cite news|last=Merica|first=Dan|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/donald-trump-travel-ban-green-card-dual-citizens|title=How Trump's travel ban affects green card holders and dual citizens|publisher=CNN |access-date=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref>

The [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] issued a press release that the restrictions apply to those traveling from the listed countries not those that merely have their citizenship.&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/presidential-executive-order-on-inbound-migration-to-us|title=Presidential executive order on inbound migration to US|date=January 29, 2017|publisher=[[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129211109/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/presidential-executive-order-on-inbound-migration-to-us|archive-date=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref> The confusion led companies and institutions to take a more cautious approach; for example, [[Google]] told its dual-national employees to stay in the United States until more clarity could be provided.&lt;ref name=cnn_dual/> On January 31, the State Department updated the restrictions to allow persons holding dual citizenship to enter the US provided they possessed a US visa and entered using a passport from an unrestricted country.&lt;ref>{{cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/officials-clarify-impact-dual-nationals-trumps-immigration-executive/story?id=45178731| title=Officials Aim to Clarify Impact on Dual Nationals From Trump's Immigration Executive Order|work=[[ABC News]] |date=February 1, 1017|access-date=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref>

===All entrants who are subject to adjudication===
Section 4 orders development of a uniform screening procedure as part of the adjudication process for immigration benefits; components of the screening procedure are suggested but not determined.&lt;ref name="auto" /> Section 1 ("Purpose") requires screening to identify those who would "place violent ideologies higher than American law" or "oppress Americans of any ... gender or sexual orientation".&lt;ref name="auto" /> The only suggested component of the uniform screening procedure in section 4 that specifically mentions a potential entrant's mindset is "a mechanism to assess whether or not the applicant has the intent to commit criminal or terrorist acts after entering the United States".&lt;ref name="auto" /> Trump's August 15 speech proposed an ideological test for all immigrants to screen out people who might harbor violent or oppressive attitudes toward women or gays.&lt;ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/14/politics/donald-trump-isis-fight/|date=August 15, 2016|title=Trump proposes values test for would-be immigrants in fiery ISIS speech|publisher=CNN }}&lt;/ref> In response, immigration expert [[Stephen Yale-Loehr]] suggested that an ideological test could involve screening immigration applicants' social media pages as part of a routine background check.&lt;ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/trump-immigration-plan-us-constitution|title=Trump's 'deeply un-American' stance on immigration prompts legal concerns|first=Lauren|last=Gambino|date=August 17, 2017|newspaper=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref> The Trump administration has formally proposed adding optional collection of social media account information for visa applicants from China affecting approximately 3.6 million people annually.&lt;ref>Federal Register Notice and Request for Comments of February 21, 2017: Agency Information Collection Activities: Electronic Visa Update System.

===Deleted provision regarding safe zones in Syria===
{{Further|Safe zone (Syria)}}
A leaked prior draft of the order (published by ''The Washington Post'' before the order went into effect) would have ordered that "the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Defense, is directed within 90 days of the date of this order to produce a plan to provide safe areas in Syria and in the surrounding region in which Syrian nationals displaced from their homeland can await firm settlement, such as repatriation or potential third-country resettlement."&lt;ref>{{cite news |title=Draft executive order would begin 'extreme vetting' of immigrants and visitors to the U.S.|date=January 25, 2017|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/draft-executive-order-would-begin-extreme-vetting-of-immigrants-and-visitors-to-the-us/2017/01/25/17a27424-e328-11e6-a547-5fb9411d332c_story.html}}&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>{{cite news |title=Read the draft of the executive order on immigration and refugees|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/world/read-the-draft-of-the-executive-order-on-immigration-and-refugees/2289|access-date=February 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref> This provision was omitted from the final order.&lt;ref name="auto"/> [[Rex Tillerson]], Trump's secretary of state, had not yet taken office at the time the executive order went into effect.&lt;ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/30/chuck-schumer-wants-delay-rex-tillerson-vote-possi|date=February 1, 2017|title=Chuck Schumer wants delay on Rex Tillerson vote, possibly other nominees, after executive order|first=Sherfinski|last=David|newspaper=The Washington Times }}&lt;/ref>

During and after his campaign Trump proposed establishing safe zones in Syria as an alternative to Syrian refugees' immigration to the U.S. In the past "safe zones" have been interpreted as establishing, among other things, no-fly zones over Syria. During the Obama administration, [[Turkey]] encouraged the U.S. to establish safe zones; the Obama administration was concerned about the potential for pulling the U.S. into a war with Russia.&lt;ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-syria-safezones-idUSKBN1592O8|title=Trump says he will order 'safe zones' for Syria|date=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref>

In the first weeks of Trump's presidency Turkey renewed its call for safe zones and proposed a new plan for them, the Trump administration has spoken with several other Sunni Arab States regarding safe zones, and Russia has asked for clarification regarding any Trump administration plan regarding safe zones. The UN High Commissioner on Refugees and [[Bashar Assad]] have dismissed safe zones as unworkable.

Trump's stated reason for issuing the executive order was to prevent terrorism.&lt;ref name="SalamaCaldwell">Vivian Salama &amp; Alicia A.

Benjamin said that the order was unlikely to reduce the terrorist threat, and "many experts believe the order's unintended consequences will make the threat worse."&lt;ref name="Shane"/> Kurzman noted that since the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, no one has been killed in the U.S. in a terrorist attack by anyone who emigrated from or whose parents emigrated from the seven affected countries.&lt;ref name="Shane"/> Jenkins explained that of the 147 Jihadist plots and attacks since 9/11, 105 were perpetrated by U.S. citizens and 20 involved legal permanent residents. "In other words, 85 percent of the terrorists lived in the U.S. a long time before carrying out an attack—they were radicalized within the nation's borders."&lt;ref name="Jenkins">{{cite web|last1=Jenkins|first1=Brian Michael |author-link=Brian Michael Jenkins |title=Why a Travel Restriction Won't Stop Terrorism at Home|url=http://www.rand.org/blog/2017/02/why-a-travel-restriction-wont-stop-terrorism-at-home.html|website=The RAND Blog|publisher=[[RAND Corporation]] |access-date=March 22, 2017|date=February 10, 2017 }}&lt;/ref> Jenkins went on to say: "Had this temporary prohibition been in effect since 9/11, how many lives would have been saved Not one."&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/> While Jenkins conceded that there were two individuals whose entry would have been prevented had the ban been in place since 9/11, both were in the country for years prior to engaging in terrorist related activities. According to Jenkins, the "... failure to identify these individuals before they entered the United States is not a flaw in the vetting process; it is our inability to predict human behavior years into the future."&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/>

According to ''The New York Times'' reporter [[Scott Shane]], the seven countries in the executive order had a "random quality"; the list excluded [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Egypt]] (where many jihadist groups were founded) and [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]] (where extremism has a long history, and which have "produced militants who have occasionally reached the United States").&lt;ref name="Shane"/> Benjamin stated that the order might be counterproductive in terms of counterterrorism cooperation and feeding into "the jihadist narrative" of a West at war with Islam.&lt;ref name="Shane"/> [[Jonathan Schanzer]] of the conservative [[Foundation for the Defense of Democracies]] said that "The order appears to be based mainly on a campaign promise," and did not appear to be tied to any effort to improve vetting or other procedures.&lt;ref name="Shane"/>

A 2021 study in the ''American Political Science Review'' found that Trump's refugee ban (which caused a 66% reduction in refugee resettlement) had no impact on crime rates.&lt;ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last1=Masterson|first1=Daniel|last2=Yasenov|first2=Vasil|date=2021|title=Does Halting Refugee Resettlement Reduce Crime?

===Implementation at airports===
Shortly after the enactment of the executive order, at 4:42&amp;nbsp;pm on January 27, border officials across the country began enforcing the new rules. ''The New York Times'' reported people with various backgrounds and statuses being denied entry or sent back; this included refugees and minority Christians from the affected countries as well as students and green-card holders returning to the United States after visits abroad.&lt;ref name=nyt_impact/>&lt;ref>{{cite news |last1=Jorgensen |first1=Sarah |title=Syrian Christian family, visas in hand, turned back at airport |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/us/syrian-family-trump-travel-ban/ |access-date=January 29, 2017 |publisher=CNN |date=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref>

On February, 3 attorneys for the DOJ's [[Office of Immigration Litigation]] advised a judge hearing one of the legal challenges to the order that more than 100,000 visas have been revoked as a consequence of the order. They also advised the judge that no legal permanent residents have been denied entry.&lt;ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/03/politics/over-100000-visas-revoked-government-lawyer-says-in-virginia-court/index.html|title=Over 100,000 visas revoked, government lawyer says in Virginia court|first=Laura |last=Jarrett|publisher=CNN |access-date=February 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref> The State Department later revised this figure downward to fewer than 60,000 revoked visas and clarified that the larger DOJ figure incorrectly included visas that were exempted from the travel ban (such as diplomatic visas) and expired visas.&lt;ref name="Caldwell">{{cite news|first=Alicia A.|last=Caldwell|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/state-fewer-60000-visas-revoked-order-45252637|title=State Says Fewer Than 60,000 Visas Revoked Under Order|work=[[ABC News]] |agency=Associated Press|date=February 3, 2017|access-date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>{{cite news |title=State Dept: Fewer than 60,000 Visas Canceled by Trump Order|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/03/state-dept-fewer-than-60000-visas-canceled-by-trump-order.html|date=February 3, 2017|publisher=Fox News|access-date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref>

The effect of the order was far broader, however, than the number of people detained. In terms of barred visa-holders, the federal government reported that more than "100,000 visas for foreigners inside and outside the United States have also been revoked, at least temporarily."&lt;ref name="SinghviParlapiano">{{cite news|authors=Anjali Singhvi &amp; Alicia Parlapiano|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/31/us/politics/trump-immigration-ban-groups.html|date=January 31, 2017 |title=Trump's Immigration Ban: Who Is Barred and Who Is Not|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref> ''The Washington Post'' fact-checker, citing State Department figures, reported that 60,000 U.S. visas were issued in the seven affected countries in fiscal year 2015.&lt;ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/01/30/the-number-of-people-affected-by-trumps-travel-ban-about-90000/|title=Fact check: White House claims 109 affected by travel ban - it's more like 90,000|first=Glenn|last=Kessler |author-link=Glenn Kessler (journalist) |newspaper=The Washington Post Fact Checker blog |date=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref> ''The New York Times'' reported that 86,000 nonimmigrant-temporary visas (mostly for tourism, business travel, temporary work, or education) have been granted to citizens in the seven affected countries in the 2015 fiscal year.&lt;ref name="SinghviParlapiano"/> The executive order also barred people from the seven countries from obtaining new immigrant visas. In 2015, 52,365 people from the seven affected countries had been issued green cards (which are typically awarded soon after the arrival of an immigrant visa-holder to the United States); "[i]n general, about half of recent new legal permanent residents are new arrivals to the country, and the other half had their status adjusted after living in the United States."&lt;ref name="SinghviParlapiano"/>

In the weeks of 2017 prior to the executive order, the U.S. admitted approximately 1,800 refugees per week (total) from the seven countries covered by the order. While the executive order was in effect, the U.S. received two refugees from those countries.&lt;ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/02/26/us/trump-refugees-muslim.html|title=Muslim Refugees Were Admitted at a Lower Rate During Trump's Refugee Ban|date=February 26, 2017|newspaper=The New York Times |first1=Audrey|last1=Carlsen|first2=K.K.

===Impact on U.S. industry===
Google called its traveling employees back to the U.S. in case the order prevented them from returning. About 100 of the company's employees were thought to be affected by the order. Google CEO [[Sundar Pichai]] wrote in a letter to his staff that "it's painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues.

One effect of Trump's election and policies, and in particular, Trump's executive order, is the "Trump Slump" on the U.S. tourism industry, which contributed $1.47 trillion to the country's GDP in 2014. As reported by [[Frommer's]], according to Global Business Travel Association, as well as local tourist offices, with policies such as Executive Order 13769 making foreigners feeling less welcome, fewer tourists began traveling to the U.S., with all foreign tourism down 6.8%, online searches for flights from foreign countries down 17%, and foreign business travel dropping by $185 million during the first week of the immigration suspension.&lt;ref>[[Arthur Frommer|Frommer, Arthur]] (February 2017).

===Travelers and patients===
According to [[Trita Parsi]], the president of the [[National Iranian American Council]], the order distressed citizens of the affected countries including those holding valid green cards and valid visas. Those outside the U.S. fear that they will not be allowed in, while those already in the country fear that they will not be able to leave, even temporarily, because they would not be able to return.&lt;ref name="nyt_iran_reaction">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/world/middleeast/trump-visa-muslim-ban.html|title=In Iran, Shock and Bewilderment Over Trump Visa Crackdown|first1=Thomas|last1=Erdbrink|first2=Jeffrey|last2=Gettleman |author2-link=Jeffrey Gettleman |date=January 27, 2017 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref>

Some sources have stated that the executive order, if upheld, is likely to contribute to a doctor shortage in the United States, disproportionately affecting rural areas and underprovided specialties.&lt;ref name=":11">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/06/health/trump-travel-ban-doctors.html|title=Trump's Travel Ban, Aimed at Terrorists, Has Blocked Doctors|last=McNeil Jr|first=Donald G. |author-link=Donald McNeil Jr. |date=February 6, 2017|newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref> According to an analysis by a [[Harvard Medical School]] group of professors, research analysts and physicians, the executive order is likely to reduce the number of physicians in the United States as approximately 5% of the foreign-trained physicians in the United States were trained in the seven countries targeted by the executive order. These doctors are disproportionately likely to practice medicine in rural, underserved regions and specialties facing a large shortage of practitioners.&lt;ref>{{cite news|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-immigration-order-could-make-it-harder-to-find-a-psychiatrist-or-pediatrician|title=Trump's Immigration Order Could Make It Harder To Find A Psychiatrist Or Pediatrician|last=Jena|first=Anupam B. |author2=Andrew Olenski |author3=Daniel M.

=== Impact on education ===

Many universities were impacted by the issuance of the travel ban. One example is Bennington College. Since nearly twenty percent of students are from around the world, some students were not allowed to return. Even students who planned to attend this college in the future were unable to.&lt;ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/marikosilver/2018/07/07/travel-ban-hurts-u-s-college-students-too/|title=Travel Ban Hurts U.S. College Students Too|last=Silver|first=Mariko|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=May 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref> Universities like New York University, updated its students on each iteration of the travel ban to keep students educated on what they can do if they are affected by the order.&lt;ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nyu.edu/students/communities-and-groups/students-affected-january-2017-executive-order.html|title=Students Affected by Travel Ban Executive Order|date=June 26, 2018|website=New York University}}&lt;/ref> Many university administrators believe that due to President Trump's view on immigration, students abroad have become reluctant to study in the United States.&lt;ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/us/international-enrollment-drop.html|title=As Flow of Foreign Students Wanes, U.S. Universities Feel the Sting|last=Saul|first=Stephanie|date=January 2, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 1, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref>

Students that have the F1 visa are put at risk with this executive order. Since F1 visas only allow these visa holders one-entry into the United States, this executive order may not allow these individuals to come back if they decide to leave the country for a school break. Due to the ban, the students on F1 visas may not be able to see their families for several years especially if their parents cannot enter the United States as a result of the ban.&lt;ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-decision-uphold-travel-ban-anxiety-uncertainty/story?id=56326492|title=Supreme Court travel ban ruling causes fear for international students: Advocates|website=ABC News|language=en|access-date=May 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref>

== Social media presence  ==

Following Trump's announcement of the order, the topic began to trend on social media. Hashtags such as #MuslimBan, #TravelBan and #BanTrumpFromUK emerged. Shortly after, protests arose urging for the cancellation of Trump's UK visit, garnering up to 1.5 million signatures.&lt;ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/30/internet-reacted-donald-trumps-controversial-travel-ban/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/30/internet-reacted-donald-trumps-controversial-travel-ban/ |archive-date=January 12, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=How the internet reacted to Donald Trump's controversial travel ban|last=Molloy|first=Mark|date=2017|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=November 23, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref>

=== #GrandParentsNotTerrorists ===
Under the new policy, citizens from Libya, Syria, Iran, Somalia, Yemen and Sudan would be banned from entering the U.S. if they couldn't prove that they have a "bona fide relationship" with families in America, which excludes grandparents, aunts, uncles or any other "distant relatives."&lt;ref name="Blumberg">{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/travel-ban-grandparents_us_59556d8ae4b05c37bb7d1790|title=Twitter Protests Trump's Travel Ban With #GrandparentsNotTerrorists|last=Blumberg|first=Antonia|date=June 29, 2017|work=Huffington Post|access-date=October 18, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref> To express the opposition to the order, the hashtag #GrandParentsNotTerrorists was launched by the [[National Iranian American Council]] (NIAC).&lt;ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/travel-ban-grandparents_us_59556d8ae4b05c37bb7d1790|title=Twitter Protests Trump's Travel Ban With #GrandparentsNotTerrorists|last=Blumberg|first=Antonia|date=June 29, 2017|work=Huffington Post|access-date=November 28, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref> The hashtag allowed residents of the six countries to use Twitter and post photos of their grandparents to protest the policy.&lt;ref name="Blumberg"/>

=== #NoBanNoWall ===
On January 24, 2017 the hashtag "#NoBanNoWall" first was seen on social media platform Twitter quickly after Donald Trump released news of executive order 13769.&lt;ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mic.com/articles/166577/nobannowall-is-a-heartbreaking-rallying-cry-against-donald-trumps-muslim-ban-and-border-wall|title=People are rallying against Trump's xenophobia with #NoBanNoWall|website=mic.com|language=en|access-date=April 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref> The use of social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram became a catalyst for an opposition movement that resulted in political mobilization and awareness of the issue.

The #nobannowall movement has been used in multiple social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram, Flickr and more. On January 25, 2017 protesters gathered at Washington Square Park in New York and chanted: "No ban, no wall".&lt;ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/grandparents-not-terrorists-tweets-highlight-how-senseless-people-think-the-travel-ban-is-67822|title=#GrandparentsNotTerrorists Hashtag Launched To Protest Travel Ban|last=Sathish|first=Madhuri|website=Bustle|language=en|access-date=April 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref>  These chants were soon used in Twitter as #nobannowall to protest President Trump's border wall and Muslim ban policies. As the hashtag became popular on Twitter it was used on other social media platforms. There are multiple Facebook groups and pages on #nobannowall along with events that were created for protests at various locations. There are currently 276K posts on Instagram with the hashtag #nobannowall&lt;ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/aishagani/no-ban-no-wall-tweets-trump|title=People Are Using The #NoBanNoWall Hashtag To Protest Trump's Border Wall|last=Gani|first=Aisha|website=BuzzFeed|language=en|access-date=April 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref> and this shows the use of various social media platforms for this social movement.

Conservative supporters of the wall and executive order responded with social media support of hashtags #BuildTheWall &lt;ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/hashtag/buildthewall|title=News about #buildthewall on Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=April 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref> and #BanTheMuslims,&lt;ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/hashtag/banthemuslims|title=#banthemuslims hashtag on Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=April 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref> among others.

=== #RefugeeCaravan ===
The refugee caravan was the several thousands of migrants that traveled a long way to the US-Mexico border trying to enter America. About 7,000 migrants have reached the border and are staying in shelters. President Trump has labeled this caravan as "an invasion." It was also reported that many Mexican citizens saw the migrants as an invasion as well, where marches were organized against the undocumented migrants being in the city.&lt;ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-interest-the-caravan-invasion-has-apparently-waned|title=Trump's interest in the caravan 'invasion' has apparently waned|date=November 9, 2018|website=MSNBC|access-date=May 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/2018/11/19/669193788/shouting-mexico-first-hundreds-in-tijuana-march-against-migrant-caravan|title=Shouting 'Mexico First', Hundreds In Tijuana March Against Migrant Caravan|website=NPR|date=November 19, 2018|access-date=June 3, 2019|last1=Fredrick|first1=James}}&lt;/ref>

&lt;nowiki>#&lt;/nowiki>RefugeeCaravan sparked awareness of what these immigrants were going through in their journey to the United States. Although this movement did not directly spark from the executive order, it is a movement that followed the events of the travel ban. The movements that emerged from this executive order and from #RefugeeCaravan were started from the same foundational belief that all people should not have to be restricted into entering the United States. Tweets updated followers of the movement on who which asylum seekers were granted entry into the United States.&lt;ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/us/migrant-caravan-asylum.html|title=A Refugee Caravan is Hoping for Asylum in the U.S. How Are These Cases Decided?|last=Jordan|first=Miriam|date=April 30, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 1, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref>

==Legal challenges==

Legal challenges to the order were brought almost immediately after its issuance. From January 28 to 31 almost 50 cases were filed in federal courts. The courts, in turn, granted temporary relief, including a nationwide [[temporary restraining order]] (TRO) that bars the enforcement of major parts of the executive order. The TRO specifically blocks the executive branch from enforcing provisions of the executive order that (1) suspend entry into the U.S. for people from seven countries for 90 days and (2) place limitations on the acceptance of refugees, including "any action that prioritizes the refugee claims of certain religious minorities."&lt;ref name="LiptakStands">{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Adam|title=Where Trump's Travel Ban Stands|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/us/politics/trumps-travel-ban.html|access-date=March 13, 2018|work=The New York Times|date=February 6, 2017|page=A10}}&lt;/ref> The TRO also allows "people from the seven countries who had been authorized to travel, along with vetted refugees from all nations, to enter the country." The Trump administration appealed the TRO.&lt;ref name="LiptakStands"/> According to the DHS inspector general, [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] officers then violated the court orders by continuing to prevent some foreign passengers from boarding flights bound for the United States.&lt;ref name=NYT20january18/>&lt;ref name=IGreport/>  DHS officials contest the DHS inspector general's finding that the court orders were violated.&lt;ref name=NYT20january18/>&lt;ref name=IGreport/>

The plaintiffs challenging the order argue that it contravenes the [[United States Constitution]], federal [[statute]]s, or both. The parties challenging the executive order include both private individuals (some of whom were blocked from entering the U.S. or detained following the executive order's issuance) and the states of Washington and Minnesota, represented by their [[state attorneys general]]. Other organizations such as the ACLU also challenged the order in court. Additionally, fifteen Democratic state attorneys general released a joint statement calling the executive order "unconstitutional, un-American and unlawful", and that "[w]e'll work together to fight it".&lt;ref>[[Edward Isaac Dovere]], [http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-immigration-attorneys-general-234338 Democratic state attorneys general vow action against refugee order], ''[[Politico]]'' (January 29, 2017).&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>Official Twitter account of New York State Attorney General Eric T.

In response to the lawsuits, the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement on January 29 that it would continue to enforce the executive order and that "prohibited travel will remain prohibited". On the same day a White House spokesperson said that the rulings did not undercut the executive order. On January 30 Acting Attorney General [[Sally Yates]], an Obama administration holdover pending the confirmation of Trump's nominee barred the Justice Department from defending the executive order in court; She said she felt the order's effects were not in keeping "with this institution's solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right".&lt;ref name="wsj 1/30">{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/acting-attorney-general-orders-justice-dept-not-to-defend-trumps-travel-ban-1485819447|title=Acting Attorney General Orders Justice Dept.

Judge Alex Kozinski of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals filed a late dissent on March 17, 2017 to the 9th Cir. opinion in ''Washington v. Trump'' arguing against the State of Washington's Establishment Clause claims on grounds that Trump's speech during the campaign was political protected by the [[First Amendment]]. (Even though the 9th Circuit had declined to address that issue in reaching its ruling on ''Washington v. Trump'' and U.S. courts do not typically rule on issues that are not before them, Kozinski argued it was ok for him to address the issue because the district judge in Hawaii had cited the 9th Circuit opinion in reaching its Establishment Clause ruling.)&lt;ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2017/03/the_9th_circuit_s_alex_kozinski_defends_trump_s_travel_ban_on_first_amendment.html|first=Richard|last=Hasen|title=Does the First Amendment Protect Trump's Travel Ban?|date=March 20, 2017|magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/03/17/17-35105_Amd_Order.pdf|date=March 17, 2017|title= No. 2:17-cv-00141 Amended Order}}&lt;/ref>

On February 13 Judge [[Leonie Brinkema]] of the Eastern District of Virginia ordered a [[preliminary injunction]] against the federal defendants in ''Aziz v.
