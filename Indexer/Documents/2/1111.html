Now, it&#8217;s going to pay for it.<\/p>\n<p>To help fend off the TikTok threat, Meta <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/creators\/reels-content-monetization-updates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> this week it will now dole out additional bonuses to Reels creators who are publishing original content on Facebook. The company warned that this change to payouts could see some creators losing money, while others gain, when compared with their prior performance. It&#8217;s also introducing a new incentive called &#8220;Challenges&#8221; that enable Facebook Reels creators to earn up to $4,000 per month for meeting certain goals.<\/p>\n<p>Not to be confused with hashtag challenges &#8212; where a company asks its creator community to post about a certain topic &#8212; Facebook&#8217;s Challenges are a way to progress through a series of bonuses to reach a maximum payout.<\/p>\n<p>Each month, creators will be able to participate in a set of sequential, cumulative challenges which build upon one other. For example, the creator might first earn $20 when at least five of their Reels reach 100 plays each. After they accomplish that goal, another would be unlocked &#8212; like earning $100 when 20 Reels reach 500 plays each. This progress would continue throughout the 30-day period, then reset at the beginning of the next month to start a new set of challenges.<\/p>\n<p>Only select creators have been invited into the <a href=\"https:\/\/help.instagram.com\/183392733628561\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reels Bonus program<\/a> at this time, notes Facebook.

And we&#8217;re supporting them with tools to monetize, both through ad revenue share bonus programs and support from fans,&#8221; she said.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Meta also announced its virtual tipping system, Stars, has expanded tests on Facebook and soon, Instagram creators will be able to crosspost their Reels to Facebook &#8212; a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/18\/facebook-tests-cross-posting-your-facebook-feed-posts-to-instagram\/\">feature it&#8217;s been testing<\/a> since last fall. As part of this expansion, Meta will test allowing creators to earn an ad revenue share on their crossposted Reels <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/creators\/overlay-ads-for-facebook-reels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">via Overlay ads<\/a>, as well.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, Meta is monetizing Overlay ads with a revenue share of 55% to the creator and 45% to Facebook. That&#8217;s a bit higher than the 50\/50 share that TikTok just announced this week <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/04\/tiktok-introduces-its-first-ad-product-to-offer-a-revenue-share-with-creators\/\">with the launch of its TikTok Pulse program.<\/a> Although Pulse is a different type of ad product, it&#8217;s the first and only ad rev share for TikTok creators at present. But since Facebook ads <a href=\"https:\/\/upbeatagency.com\/tiktok-ads-vs-facebook-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">still tend to be<\/a> more expensive than TikTok&#8217;s, it&#8217;s hard to say yet which rev share would be more beneficial to a creator&#8217;s bottom line.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the bigger news coming out this week is that Facebook is taking a step to make earning bonuses less of a black box.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, creators were <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/11\/instagram-bonuses-reels-tiktok\/\">earning outsized rewards<\/a> &#8212; even as much as $10,000 or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/11\/12\/22777899\/instagram-reels-bonus-program-35000-dollars-creators-tiktok-competitors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more<\/a> &#8212; but the numbers have since come down, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2022\/4\/6\/23013399\/instagram-reels-payments-cuts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">some creators have said.<\/a> The FT <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/df2d753d-4346-49d8-88d7-441156dc8dc3?shareType=nongift\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported<\/a> creators found the number of views it was taking to meet a bonus target had increased, which made it harder to achieve their threshold. But because Meta&#8217;s system is dynamic and personalized, it can be difficult to really understand what Meta&#8217;s targets are.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"X9g5nifWVX\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/11\/instagram-bonuses-reels-tiktok\/\">Instagram is offering huge bonuses for posting on Reels, its TikTok clone<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Instagram is offering huge bonuses for posting on Reels, its TikTok clone&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/11\/instagram-bonuses-reels-tiktok\/embed\/#?secret=JVd1jZ9GL3#?secret=X9g5nifWVX\" data-secret=\"X9g5nifWVX\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>On that front, Meta will now at least introduce a way for individual creators to track their bonuses in one place to see how well they&#8217;re doing.<\/p>\n<p>Meta says it&#8217;s introducing a Reels Play Bonus Insight page on Facebook, where they&#8217;ll be able to see how many plays each of their eligible Reels received within a given earning period.<\/p>\n<p>The changes to the Bonus program follow <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/20\/instagram-ranking-system-recommend-original-content\/\">another recent move by the company<\/a> to change its algorithms to prioritize original content over reposts or other aggregated content from other sources.

href=\"https:\/\/www.penguinrandomhouse.com\/books\/609362\/the-last-graduate-by-naomi-novik\/\">a viscous cliffhanger<\/a>, and all you want to do is gab with other fans about what might happen next, but none of your friends have read the book. You might find fan discussions on Reddit, Tumblr or Discord, but it can be a bit of a crapshoot.<\/p>\n<p>The founder and CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/copperbooks.com\/\">Copper<\/a>, Allison Trowbridge wanted to build a social network that revolves around books, connecting authors and fans through in-app discussions and live events. As <a href=\"https:\/\/bookshop.org\/books\/twenty-two-letters-to-a-young-woman-searching-for-meaning\/9780718078164\">an author herself<\/a>, she also wanted to help writers find new income streams, whether that&#8217;s through ticketed virtual events, or just generating enough conversation around a book that more people buy it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You have Twitch for the gamers, and Etsy for the crafters, and Spotify and SoundCloud for the musicians,&#8221; Trowbridge said. &#8220;Authors have never had a platform that&#8217;s built around their needs, and helping them reach an audience and do it in a way that&#8217;s authentic and engaging and can scale, but also creates depth in the relationships.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Authors on Copper can host FaceTime-like discussions about their work, which they will be able to sell tickets for in a later version of the app. They can also engage in text-based forum discussions with fans, helping deepen their relationship with their readers. The app will always have a free version for both authors and fans, but later this year, Trowbridge wants to create a premium version of the app, which would offer paying users additional features.<\/p>\n<p>Copper is part of a growing crop of companies that want to help connect authors with readers. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/12\/with-sales-momentum-bookshop-org-looks-to-future-in-its-fight-with-amazon\/\">Bookshop.org<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/libro.fm\/\">Libro.fm<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/21\/folios-24-year-old-founder-is-bootstrapping-a-curated-online-bookstore\/\">Folio<\/a> have offered consumers an alternative to Amazon, while apps like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thestorygraph.com\/\">The Storygraph<\/a> are trying to dethrone the dormant Goodreads.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2312608\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2312608\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2312608\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/copper-ios-mockups.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/copper-ios-mockups.png 4012w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/copper-ios-mockups.png?resize=150,89 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/copper-ios-mockups.png?resize=300,179 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/copper-ios-mockups.png?resize=768,458 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/copper-ios-mockups.png?resize=680,405 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/copper-ios-mockups.png?resize=1536,915 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/copper-ios-mockups.png?resize=2048,1220 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/copper-ios-mockups.png?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2312608\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Copper<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Though book sales are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.authorsguild.org\/industry-advocacy\/book-sales-up-readership-down\/\">increasing<\/a> each year, Trowbridge thinks there hasn&#8217;t been meaningful change in the way authors can grow their audience, sell more books and make writing a more sustainable career (if you&#8217;re lucky, your self-published book might go viral on TikTok, earn you a book deal and become a New York Times best-seller, but we can&#8217;t all be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.panmacmillan.com\/blogs\/science-fiction-and-fantasy\/tor-uk-acquires-the-atlas-six-fantasy-book-olivie-blake\">Olivie Blake<\/a>).<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Goodreads, for instance, remains a go-to platform for discovery, but its interface hasn&#8217;t visibly changed since <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2013\/03\/28\/amazon-acquires-social-reading-site-goodreads\/\">Amazon bought<\/a> it in 2013. Plus, Trowbridge noted, emerging authors are told to never look at the Goodreads reviews of their books (&#8220;You&#8217;ll never want to write another book again,&#8221; she jokes). It might be a useful platform for readers looking for book recommendations, but it&#8217;s not the most author-friendly website. Copper hopes to make a product that&#8217;s fun and useful for both readers and writers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For authors, you&#8217;re not just a writer. You&#8217;re kind of a micro-entrepreneur,&#8221; Trowbridge told TechCrunch. That statement might repulse some literary types, but promotion is a means to an end &#8212; unless if you&#8217;re an established superstar, you probably don&#8217;t have much help marketing the book you worked so hard on.&#8221;Once the book is written, you&#8217;re really doing a product launch, and you&#8217;re spending six months thinking about how to launch this product and sell it to an engaged audience that&#8217;s going to to buy it and read it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So far, Copper has secured $2.5 million in pre-seed funding led by Wave Capital, and including key individual investors like former Time Inc. executive Fran Hauser. Best-selling author and Wharton professor Adam Grant has also been a crucial advisor to the project.<\/p>\n<p>As Copper launches out of private beta on <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/copper-books\/id1557778850?utm_source=Marketing+Email&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=Copper+Books\">iOS<\/a>, the app has a waitlist of 6,000 potential users, half of whom are published authors. Trowbridge says Copper has had &#8220;several hundred&#8221; of these authors onboard during private beta.<\/p>\n<p>A primary selling point of Copper is the promise of community, but community can&#8217;t exist without enough users.

And that&#8217;s all, for now.<\/p>\n<p>Going forward, the firm will only invest in existing portfolio companies, meaning that Backstage Capital is no longer making net new investments. The firm says that it will remain active and grow assets under management &#8212; including the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.backstagecapitalopportunityfund.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in-the-works $30 million opportunity fund <\/a>and<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/greenroom\/backstage-capital-receives-1m-investment-from-comcast-44d06e357972\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> $1 million from Comcast <\/a>&#8212; but that cash will only be put toward follow-on rounds in Backstage companies.<\/p>\n<p>With the Opportunity Fund still being raised, Backstage plans to invest $250,000 to $1 million across 30 companies, and also reserve funding for further follow-on funding. This check size is up from Backstage\u2019s initial average check size of $40,000.<\/p>\n<p>The shift, which will be announced at Backstage&#8217;s stakeholder meeting later today, is a rare &#8212; if unprecedented &#8212; move for a venture firm to take so publicly. The move might cause some to speculate that the firm&#8217;s pause means trouble, because most firms use growing investment vehicles to invest in both existing and new portfolio companies. However, Backstage thinks that it has hit enough companies, for now, to pause and turn inward.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere will be people who take this negatively or will take this as us not being active, and it is anything but,\u201d Hamilton said to TechCrunch in an e-mail, noting Backstage\u2019s investment cadence outpaces other funds. \u201cSo we are being strategic and thoughtful in our approach, as we always have.\u201d<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Backstage is giving a huge stamp of validation to its existing portfolio by betting the firm\u2019s future returns on the cohort. It noted that early checks have helped it land access to spots in limited rounds, such as in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/10\/career-karma-lands-40-million-to-evolve-into-a-edtech-employee-benefit\/\">Career Karma\u2019s $40 million Series B round. <\/a>In an interview with TechCrunch, general partner Brittany Davis spoke to the next phase.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo I think about creating value, and I think in the early days, creating that value was fighting this notion against being a pipeline founder, Davis said. \u201cThe 200 portfolio kinda answers that &#8212; and then the next phase is on creating value for the companies.\u201d Hamilton said that she is personally an investor in over 25 funds, and has over 500 funds in Backstage\u2019s co-investing network. Backstage thinks that the detail underscores just how many options there are for early-stage founders that didn\u2019t exist before. While this is certainly true, data shows that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/03\/female-founders-are-making-a-buzzing-venture-backed-comeback\/\">despite an uptick<\/a>, historically overlooked founders still receive disproportionately less funding than their white, male counterparts; it&#8217;s always going to be important for there to be more check-writers dedicated to this cohort.<\/p>\n<p>Backstage Capital says the strategy shift was not in response to the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/12\/its-not-a-startup-reckoning-its-a-recorrection\/\">market\u2019s shifting to be more disciplined. <\/a>The majority of the portfolio is considered early-stage so the partners view their companies insulated from a lot of the movements in the market; unicorns, on the other hand, have been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/04\/cameo-layoff-unicorn\/\">dealing with cuts after a pandemic boom. <\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u201cI&#8217;ve seen other investors talking about how they are marking-down companies or are creating a hierarchy in their portfolio of health based on who they are going to succeed, and we are deliberately not going in that direction,\u201d Davis said.<\/p>\n<p>That said, the firm isn\u2019t the first institution to change strategy over the past few months. Venture firm Homebrew announced in March that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/01\/one-decade-in-homebrew-says-its-becoming-self-funded\/\">it would leave the \u201cstrictly seed\u201d stage of investing<\/a> and pursue a stage-agnostic, capital-evergreen model. The firm is also going self-funded for its next fund, investing capital solely from general partners Hunter Walk and Satya Patel. The shift gave Homebrew the ability to not be in constant fundraising mode, and invest without needing returns to hit in a specific time bracket. Another institution, Techstars, announced a fund to back <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/28\/techstars-pre-seed-accelerator-fund-rising-stars\/\">startups too early for even its own accelerator<\/a> &#8212; joining a cadre of early-stage firms in gong earlier to get an upper edge against late-stage-focused funds.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"FdmlQyv4RX\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/30\/if-the-earliest-investors-keep-going-earlier-what-will-happen\/\">If the earliest investors keep going earlier, what will happen?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;If the earliest investors keep going earlier, what will happen?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/30\/if-the-earliest-investors-keep-going-earlier-what-will-happen\/embed\/#?secret=amJCQfxqlR#?secret=FdmlQyv4RX\" data-secret=\"FdmlQyv4RX\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Christie Pitts, general partner at Backstage Capital, told TecCrunch that the shift is a reflection of priorities.

Last year saw record-breaking totals of venture capital pumped into upstart tech companies around the world, with some startups raising two or even three times in a single 12-month period if they were particularly in demand.<\/p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t merely traditional venture firms that were busy last year \u2014 corporate venture players (CVC funds) were gunning capital into the market as well.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Read it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/subscribe\/?tpcc=theexchange\">every morning on TechCrunch+<\/a> or get <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletters\">The Exchange newsletter<\/a> every Saturday.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>As <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/27\/corporate-venture-capital-follows-the-same-trend-as-other-vc-markets-up\/\">The Exchange explored last August<\/a>, the value of deals involving CVCs was rising both in dollar and deal terms; corporates were not immune to the bull rush into startup equity that captured the minds and wallets of investors.

force next spring and we are getting ready for enforcement as soon as the first notifications come in,&#8221; Vestager said today in a <a

Berlin.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This next chapter is exciting. It means a lot of concrete preparations,&#8221; the EU&#8217;s competition chief went on. &#8220;It&#8217;s about setting up new structures within the Commission, pooling resources from DG Comp [Directorate-General for Competition] and Cnect [Directorate-General for Communications] based on relevant experience. It&#8217;s about hiring staff. It&#8217;s about preparing the IT systems. It&#8217;s about drafting further legal texts on procedures or notification forms. Our teams are currently busy with all these preparations and we&#8217;re aiming to come forward with the new structures very soon.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>EU lawmakers reached political agreement on the ex ante regulation back in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/24\/dma-political-agreement\/\">March<\/a>, paving the way for full adoption later this year of a draft law which was only proposed by the Commission at the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/15\/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants\/\">end of 2020<\/a> &#8212; underscoring how much consensus there is across the bloc&#8217;s institutions of the need to rein in Big Tech.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"XCYF4WFpOo\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/24\/dma-political-agreement\/\">Europe says yes to messaging interoperability as it agrees on major new regime for Big Tech<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Europe says yes to messaging interoperability as it agrees on major new regime for Big Tech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/24\/dma-political-agreement\/embed\/#?secret=aG6NtVYk8N#?secret=XCYF4WFpOo\" data-secret=\"XCYF4WFpOo\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>However there has been some concern that the Commission will not be immediately ready for the new, centralized enforcement role it&#8217;s taking on as the DMA&#8217;s &#8216;sheriff&#8217; of Big Tech &#8212; a role which will consist of assessing whether platform giants are sticking to the ex ante regulation&#8217;s long list of up-front &#8216;dos and don&#8217;ts&#8217;, which cover detailed (and sometimes technically complex) compliance obligations related to issues such as self-preferencing, FRAND terms, interoperability and portability, to name a few.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The Commission will also be responsible for taking effective enforcement action to bring any obligation-breaching gatekeepers quickly into line.<\/p>\n<p>The tech giants that will be subject to the DMA have not yet been designated. But the criteria of &#8220;a core platform service&#8221; with &#8220;significant&#8221; impact on the EU&#8217;s internal market; a market capitalisation of at least \u20ac75BN (or an annual turnover of \u20ac7.5BN); <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">at least 45M monthly end users in the EU and 10,000+ annual business users, as well as an entrenched market position means the usual GAFAM giants are certainly in the frame.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Vestager herself has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/23\/vestager-apple\/\">previously implied <\/a>the task of effectively enforcing the incoming rules against such well-resourced tech giants will be difficult &#8212; citing, earlier this year, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/28\/apple-acm-dating-apps-tenth-fine\/\">ongoing tug-of-war between the Netherlands&#8217; antitrust authority and Apple<\/a> over App Store rules &#8212; so her remarks today may be intended to subtly correct any perceived <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/arcapde\/status\/1509487106539892741\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lack of confidence<\/a> in the Commission&#8217;s understanding of its mission.<\/p>\n<p>The slightly longer lead in time for the DMA coming into force also gives the EU more time to get properly ready, of course.<\/p>\n<p>But more prep times inevitably means a longer runway before any enforcement is possible &#8212; which may redirect fresh criticism at the Commission as any delay in addressing glaringly obvious Big Tech breaches will bolster the critique that the EU failed to take the mission seriously enough for the legislation to have the sought for impact of ensuring digital markets remain (or, well, <em>become<\/em>) open and contestable <em>fast<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The regulation provides for a three month notification period for gatekeepers to declare themselves to the Commission &#8212; and up to around two additional months for the EU&#8217;s executive body to confirm the designation &#8212; so there will still be a multi month period after the DMA enters into force before any enforcements are likely to flow.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, it could be fall 2023 before we see any real fireworks. So the Commission may quickly find itself taking flak that even its new &#8216;faster&#8217; ex ante regulatory regime isn&#8217;t quick enough to put meaningful limits on the &#8216;move fast and break things&#8217; Big Tech cartel.<\/p>\n<p>Vestager&#8217;s speech also only tentatively frames the EU as being perhaps &#8220;slightly ahead&#8221; on the global stage when it comes to laying &#8220;the future of digital markets&#8221; with a &#8220;hybrid approach&#8230; in which both ex ante regulation and traditional competition tools will both play their part&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Is that more subtle managing of expectations on her part? EU citizens can only wait to find out &#8212; but how long the Commission will leave consumers and markets waiting for DMA enforcement is the killer question.<\/p>\n<p>A big chunk of Vestager&#8217;s speech at the ICN conference also focused on the need for wide-ranging cooperation between competition regulators to, as she argued it, effectively tackle the challenges posed by digital markets &#8212; a theme she&#8217;s often talked up before. Although cynics might say that linking the EU&#8217;s success here to global alignment with its regulatory approach smacks of pro-active buck passing &#8212; especially given the competition commissioner&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/11\/dont-break-up-big-tech-regulate-data-access-says-eu-antitrust-chief\/\">long stated preference<\/a> for less radical remedies for tackling platform power in digital markets vs the stronger medicine of actually breaking tech giants up.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For that next chapter, close cooperation with competition authorities, both inside and outside the EU will be crucial,&#8221; she emphasized today. &#8220;This is irrespective of whether they apply traditional enforcement tools or have developed their own specific regulatory instruments, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/04\/meta-germany-fco-antitrust\/\">like the German digital regulation<\/a>. Close cooperation will be necessary because we will not be short of work and we will not be short of novel services or practices to look at. And the efforts needed at a global scale are enormous. So we will need to work together more than ever.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Vestager suggested cooperation is already happening as part of preparatory work for the DMA &#8212; which she said will involve &#8220;discussing with national competition authorities our future cooperation within the DMA, as well as coordination between the DMA and existing national regulations&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Many of you will be watching the roll out of the DMA with great interest. This will be a mutual learning experience.

Iceland&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/sidekickhealth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sidekick Health<\/a> has developed a gamified digital care platform that&#8217;s designed to support healthcare outcomes by applying personalized behavioral lifestyle nudges, including alongside clinical treatments like drugs, to augment, extend and support patient care for a range of chronic diseases and conditions from cancer to cardiovascular health, diabetes and arthritis &#8212; a formula that&#8217;s now scored it $55M in Series B growth funding.<\/p>\n<p>The new round is led by London-based VC firm Novator Ventures, with participation from Wellington Partners, Asabys Partners, and Frumtak Ventures, as well as a US-based strategic investor which it&#8217;s not disclosing yet but says will be revealed at a later stage. The\u00a02014-founded startup raised a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/28\/sidekick-health-scores-20m-for-its-gamified-digital-care-platform\/\">$20M Series A back in 2020<\/a> from many of the same investors.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As the Series B closes, Novator Ventures&#8217; general partner and founder Birgir Mar Ragnarsson is joining Sidekick\u2019s board.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Commenting in a statement, he said: \u201cIt has been impressive to follow the rapid growth of the company from the close of its A round 18 months ago. The company may have begun in the Nordics but I am proud to say that Sidekick is now a globally-recognized digital therapeutics player. Novator Ventures recognizes the immense opportunities presented by third generation therapeutics and Sidekick\u2019s ability to scale and operate at the global level. We look forward to working closely with the Sidekick team to transform how healthcare is delivered.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"xuKAoSTT67\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/20\/the-growing-power-of-digital-healthcare-6-trends-to-watch-in-2022\/\">The growing power of digital healthcare: 6 trends to watch in 2022<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The growing power of digital healthcare: 6 trends to watch in 2022&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/20\/the-growing-power-of-digital-healthcare-6-trends-to-watch-in-2022\/embed\/#?secret=JFnDVxZBGw#?secret=xuKAoSTT67\" data-secret=\"xuKAoSTT67\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Sidekick Health still isn&#8217;t breaking out overall customer numbers (it&#8217;s a b2b digital health business so its targeting health insurance firms and pharma companies) but says it&#8217;s inked partnerships with some of the biggest names in healthcare &#8212; such as US-based Anthem to offer &#8220;digital-first&#8221; care programs, and global pharma giants Bayer and Pfizer, to develop what it describes as &#8220;integrated combination therapeutics consisting of a molecular drug and a digital therapeutic&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The startup tells us its platform has helped 40,000+ patients globally at this stage, with its products currently available in six languages. It largest markets are Europe and the U.S., while it has offices in the U.S., Germany, Sweden and its home market of Iceland. Flush with growth funding it says it has a big U.S. push planned.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Europe and the U.S. are currently our largest markets but we are forging some partnerships in Asia,&#8221; it tells TechCrunch. &#8220;But it is early days, and we will be focusing hard on increasing our commercial footprint in the U.S. going forward.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSidekick will use the funding to support and expand our existing U.S. presence. Our North American strength and focus is exemplified by the recent additions of Pamela Stahl (CCO and President, North America) and Mitchell Mudra (COO) to the team. By 2026, it is estimated a billion people will be served by some form of DTx [digital therapeutics] annually. Coupled with the U.S. spending a very high proportion of GDP on healthcare, the U.S. is a market where our products and services will achieve the strongest patient outcomes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The startup tells TechCrunch it grew revenue threefold in 2021 &#8212; attributing that growth to a mix of existing and new commercial relationships. &#8220;This year Sidekick plans to double our team from 120 to 240 team members across our four office locations,\u201d it adds.<\/p>\n<p>Pharma giants look keen on digital therapeutics not only as a scalable tool to (potentially) augment the efficacy of their drugs with app-based support (e.g. by putting digital tools in patients&#8217; hands that can help remind them to take pills and support them in other ways, such as to make beneficial lifestyle changes around diet and exercise, or get on-demand help with mental health issues or pain management etc), but as a way to extend the value of medicines &#8212; enabling drug giants to file new patents linking existing medicines to digital therapeutic programs that are far cheaper and easier to develop and iterate than he costly business of drug discovery and research.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are building towards a portfolio of over 40 medical-grade digital therapeutics by 2026,&#8221; says Sidekick, discussing its product roadmap. &#8220;Currently, 18 are in Research &amp; Development, with a total of 14 commercial partnerships secured so far, either with payers or pharma partners or, in some cases, both.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSidekick has commercialized digital therapeutic products already, in therapeutic areas ranging from rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and breast cancer,&#8221; it adds. &#8220;We will prioritize a substantial amount of our resources towards expanding our oncology portfolio, as well as investing into increased personalization, which will allow us to serve people with multiple chronic conditions even better.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>With Series B funding in the bank, Sidekick also has more partnerships in the works &#8212; with three new collaborations set to be announced in the coming months including one focused on supporting patients with breast cancer by helping patients manage side effects.<\/p>\n<p>The startup has published a number of studies aimed at proving out the efficacy of its digital therapeutics &#8211;including looking at use of its platform to reduce stress and fatigue in patients with <a href=\"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/ecco-jcc\/article\/15\/Supplement_1\/S391\/6286503\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">inflammatory bowel disease<\/a>;

and this small randomized control trial examining use of its digital lifestyle program for outpatient treatment of <a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/1932296820942286?journalCode=dsta\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Type 2 diabetes<\/a>, to name a few &#8212; and it says it takes &#8220;life science-grade evidence generation very seriously to ensure that we offer clinical companies a clinical-grade product for their patients&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Top 10 and 20 pharma and Top 3 Payers are partnering with us on their \u2018future of franchise\u2019 assets, in areas like oncology, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immunology and immunotoxicology,&#8221;

the company which owns Tinder and a number of other dating apps, has led to a preliminary investigation by the Netherlands&#8217; Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) into whether the tech giant is abusing a dominant position, the regulator said today.<\/p>\n<p>Match Group declined to comment on the substance of its complaint &#8212; but the ACM confirmed it has received &#8220;a request for enforcement regarding the Google Play Store.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Dating-app providers allegedly are no longer able to use a payment system other than Google\u2019s payment system. In addition, dating apps claim they are no longer allowed to refer to other payment methods either,&#8221; the ACM also said in a short press statement.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Dating-app provider [Match Group] has asked ACM to assess whether Google abuses its dominant position with these practices. ACM will therefore conduct a preliminary investigation in response to this request.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The regulator declined to answer questions about the complaint.<\/p>\n<p>In its own statement, a Google spokesperson told us:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>Like any business, Google charges for services but Match Group\u2019s apps are eligible to pay just 15% on Google Play for digital subscriptions, which is the lowest rate among major app platforms. But even if they don\u2019t want to comply with Google Play\u2019s policies, Android still provides them multiple ways of distributing their apps to Android users, including through other Android app stores, directly to users via their website or as consumption-only apps.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"TYM8BOCQFg\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/25\/how-europe-has-expanded-its-bid-to-disrupt-big-tech\/\">How Europe has expanded its bid to disrupt Big Tech<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How Europe has expanded its bid to disrupt Big Tech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/25\/how-europe-has-expanded-its-bid-to-disrupt-big-tech\/embed\/#?secret=5EAEsvNwix#?secret=TYM8BOCQFg\" data-secret=\"TYM8BOCQFg\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The ACM has been locked in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/24\/acm-apple-fine\/\">a lengthy battle with iOS maker Apple over its app store payment rules<\/a> as applied to local dating apps &#8212; which led it to order that Apple must allow dating apps to use alternative payment processing services and issue a series of fines as the regulator judged Apple had failed to comply with the order.<\/p>\n<p>The fines hit the maximum allowed for by an associated court order by the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/28\/apple-acm-dating-apps-tenth-fine\/\">end of March<\/a> &#8212; \u20ac50 million &#8212; when the ACM said it was considering a revised offer by Apple. However, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/dutch-watchdog-acm-investigate-google-play-store-practices-2022-05-04\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reuters<\/a>, the regulator has decided Apple&#8217;s offer still does not comply with its order and it reports being told on Monday that the ACM is preparing a new order with new penalty payments.<\/p>\n<p>The enforcement tug of war between the ACM and Apple <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/23\/vestager-apple\/\">attracted high level attention<\/a> from the European Commission, with EVP Margrethe Vestager hitting out at Apple for deliberating choosing to pay a fine rather than comply in remarks back in February.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s notable because the Commission itself will in charge of enforcing a new ex ante competition regime against the most powerful tech giants which is due to come into force across the EU later this year.<\/p>\n<p>The bloc&#8217;s lawmakers agreed the final details of the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/25\/how-europe-has-expanded-its-bid-to-disrupt-big-tech\/\">Digital Markets Act<\/a> (DMA) <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/24\/dma-political-agreement\/\">in March<\/a> &#8212; cementing a regime that will enforce a set of operational rules on so-called &#8220;internet gatekeepers&#8221; which look set to shrink Apple&#8217;s and Google&#8217;s ability to micromanage how business users must operate on their app stores.<\/p>\n<p>Under the incoming pan-EU regulation, fines can scale up to 10% of global annual turnover for gatekeeper non-compliance with the regulation&#8217;s up-front obligations.

self-serve SDK to expand its reach for indie developers wanting to add custom keyboard software to their apps.<\/p>\n<p>The Barcelona-based mobile keyboard software maker has been pursuing a white label licensing approach to selling its customizable keyboard tech for several years but it&#8217;s now looking to expand its B2B business via a more accessible freemium software-as-a-service model.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Developers want something to build fast, and we\u2019re serving them now with this platform,&#8221; says CEO and co-founder Olivier Plante. &#8220;We serve dozens of companies using our [earlier] Custom SDK \u2026 under a license model but with this platform, the future is to enable developers to build value on top and share their integrations with other developers, that\u2019s the beauty of the platform enabled by developers &#8212; we\u2019ll sooner get to an ubiquitous typing across screens where Fleksy will power it all.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Plante says demand from indie devs for Fleksy&#8217;s customizable keyboard software, which includes features like next word prediction and swipe to input, is coming from mobile centric regions including Europe and the U.S., and from consumer apps such as health, productivity, social media, P2P payments and CRM apps, among others.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Since the Keyboard is extending their capabilities, reaching the end user across any apps &#8212; it increases usage and retention of their app,&#8221; he suggests, adding: &#8220;We are also getting developers searching to improve their own in-app experience &#8212; especially in the Productivity\/Utility Apps [category].&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Per Plante, Fleksy is seeing interest in the keyboard tech from developers working on apps outside the mobile space &#8212; such as for AR\/VR devices, automotive and out of home displays.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;All our competition is focusing on licensing, long sales cycles &#8212; the Keyboard SDK landscape is Fleksy\u2019s now &#8212; and we invite all types of companies\/sizes\/ indie devs to try out our SDK &#8212; no strings attached!&#8221; he adds.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed

institutions.<\/p>\n<p>He may also (currently) be too busy <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1521807738317066240\">trolling owners of NFTs<\/a> to notice or care about an &#8220;invitation to speak&#8221; to parliamentarians of a country on the other side of the Atlantic.<\/p>\n<p>But he probably should take up the invite &#8212; because it&#8217;s a sign of things to come if he succeeds in his mission to own Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/26\/elon-musk-free-speech-regulation\/\">we reported earlier<\/a>, there is a growing patchwork of international regulations that already and\/or will soon apply to the speech platform.

which called for &#8220;greater transparency of bots and automated and spam accounts,&#8221; as well as referencing its more recent <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/24\/dcms-committee-report-on-online-safety-bill\/\">report on the Online Safety Bill<\/a> &#8212; which &#8220;discussed ways to balance civil liberties like freedom of expression with the need to tackle pernicious, pervasive online child sexual exploitation and abuse,&#8221; as he puts it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I therefore wish to take this opportunity to invite you to speak before our committee and discuss your proposals in more depth,&#8221;

in a claimed bid to quash trolling and abuse on online platforms.<\/p>\n<p>However the government unveiled a compromise approach <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/24\/uk-online-safety-bill-anonymous-trolling\/\">earlier this year<\/a> that would require the largest platforms to provide users with tools to limit how much (potentially) harmful but technically legal content they get exposed to by<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;

faces years of tougher antitrust oversight in Germany"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Facebook&#8217;s rebranded parent, Meta, has become the next tech giant to be confirmed as subject to a special competition abuse control regime in Germany, following a 2021 update to its digital competition rules that are focused on large digital companies which are considered to be of \u201cparamount significance for competition across markets\u201d, as the law puts it.<\/p>\n<p>The designation, which stands for five years, empowers the regulator, the Federal Cartel Office (FCO), to take faster action to respond to competition concerns linked to Meta&#8217;s operations by imposing operational conditions intended to correct antitrust abuses.<\/p>\n<p>The FCO said Meta has not sought to appeal the designation &#8212; which Meta confirmed. But the social media giant told us it disagrees with some of the findings, such as that it is dominant in the market for private social networks &#8212; pointing to what it claims is vigorous competition for consumers&#8217; attention from other social platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, Snap and Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement on the designation, a Meta spokesperson said:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;While we disagree with the reasoning leading to the FCO&#8217;s decision, our focus remains on delivering the best possible experience to our users in Germany in compliance with all laws and regulations. We look forward to continuing to work constructively with the FCO.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Back in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/05\/germany-fco-google-decision\/\">January<\/a> the FCO designated Google as the first tech giant to meet the threshold for the ex ante competition regime to apply. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/12\/google-news-showcase-fco-offers\/\">Shortly afterwards<\/a>, the tech giant offered concessions on how it operates its news licensing product, Google Showcase, in the country as an FCO probe of Showcase&#8217;s small print (ongoing <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/04\/in-latest-big-tech-antitrust-push-germanys-fco-targets-google-news-showcases-fine-print\/\">since June 2021<\/a>) continued.<\/p>\n<p>The FCO also has a number of extant cases pertaining to Meta&#8217;s businesses &#8212; including a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/07\/german-antitrust-office-limits-facebooks-data-gathering\/\">pioneering decision it took back in 2019<\/a> which sought to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/09\/is-europe-closing-in-on-an-antitrust-fix-for-surveillance-technologists\/\">ban Facebook from combining user data across its suite of social platforms<\/a> without people&#8217;s consent. Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/23\/antitrust-case-against-facebooks-super-profiling-back-on-track-after-german-federal-court-ruling\/\">challenged the order in court<\/a>, arguing that the competition regulator does not have jurisdiction over privacy related issues. Whereas the FCO argues Facebook&#8217;s consentless combining of user data to build &#8216;superprofiles&#8217; for ad targeting amounts to &#8220;exploitative abuse&#8221; &#8212; a practice dominant companies must not engage in under German law.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/24\/competition-challenge-to-facebooks-superprofiling-of-users-sparks-referral-to-europes-top-court\/\">March last year<\/a> a German court referred a number of legal questions attached to this &#8216;superprofiling&#8217; case to the European Union&#8217;s top court &#8212; which has still yet to issue a judgement. So it&#8217;s likely progress on that particular antitrust intervention will remain pending the CJEU&#8217;s input regardless of Meta now being subject to the updated German competition regime, given the intervention pre-dates the amended legislation.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/10\/facebook-hit-with-antitrust-probe-for-tying-oculus-use-to-facebook-accounts\/\">Since 2020<\/a>, the FCO has also been investigating Meta tying use of its VR platform, Oculus, to having a Facebook account as another potential anti-competition abuse.<\/p>\n<p>The FCO suggests that the designation of Meta as a company of \u201cparamount significance for competition across markets\u201d means it will be able to conclude such procedures faster than it would otherwise in the future &#8212; which suggests that, as the tech giant seeks to execute an already very <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/27\/meta-facebook-q1-2022-earnings\/\">expensive &#8216;pivot to the metaverse&#8217;<\/a>, Germany&#8217;s regulator will be watching for any unfair manoeuvring as Meta tries to pull off this metamorphosis (and probably watching Meta&#8217;s &#8216;metaverse&#8217; rather more closely <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedrum.com\/news\/2021\/11\/01\/facebook-beware-study-shows-most-americans-don-t-care-about-the-metaverse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">than the average consumer<\/a>&#8230; ).<\/p>\n<p>Commenting in a statement [which we&#8217;ve translated from German with machine translation], FCO president, Andreas Mundt, said: &#8220;Thanks to the digital ecosystem created by Meta with a very large number of users, the company is the central player in the field of social media. According to our investigations, Meta is also a company of outstanding cross-market importance in terms of antitrust law. We have now formally established its position after at times contentious proceedings. Our finding puts us in a position to take action against any violations of competition law much more efficiently than we were able to do with the instruments available to date. Meta has waived an appeal against our decision.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"MIwig8nYTl\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/10\/facebook-hit-with-antitrust-probe-for-tying-oculus-use-to-facebook-accounts\/\">Facebook hit with antitrust probe for tying Oculus use to Facebook accounts<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook hit with antitrust probe for tying Oculus use to Facebook accounts&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/10\/facebook-hit-with-antitrust-probe-for-tying-oculus-use-to-facebook-accounts\/embed\/#?secret=o5sueUbq0U#?secret=MIwig8nYTl\" data-secret=\"MIwig8nYTl\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2>Tougher rules for big tech<\/h2>\n<p>Germany is ahead of the curve on updating digital competition rules to respond to Big Tech&#8217;s market power, which has become a source of major concern for policymakers around the world.<\/p>\n<p>The European Union is in the process of similarly updating pan-EU rules to introduce an ex ante regime called the Digital Markets Act (DMA) &#8212; and EU lawmakers arrived at a political agreement on the legislation <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/24\/dma-political-agreement\/\">in March<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Some procedural steps remain to pass the law so the DMA is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/25\/how-europe-has-expanded-its-bid-to-disrupt-big-tech\/\">not expected to begin applying until later this year<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In recent years, the UK has also <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/27\/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech\/\">said it will legislate for a &#8220;pro-competition&#8221; reform<\/a> of competition rules targeting platforms with so-called &#8220;strategic market status&#8221;.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/15\/edpb-cef-public-sector-cloud\/\">Earlier this year<\/a>, a number of data protection agencies kicked off a coordinated enforcement action focused on public sector bodies&#8217; use of cloud services &#8212; with the goal of investigating whether adequate data protection measures are applied, including when data is exported out of the bloc. And the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), which is steering the action, is due to publish a &#8216;state of play&#8217; report before the end of 2022 &#8212; matching Google&#8217;s timeline for rolling out (some of) the new controls.<\/p>\n<p>There have also, in recent months, been decisions by data protection agencies finding certain uses of tools like Google Analytics to be incompatible with the bloc&#8217;s privacy laws.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Nr0rrZ0ois\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/15\/edpb-cef-public-sector-cloud\/\">Public sector bodies&#8217; use of cloud services probed in joint EU data protection enforcement<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Public sector bodies&#8217; use of cloud services probed in joint EU data protection enforcement&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/15\/edpb-cef-public-sector-cloud\/embed\/#?secret=4z7FXd1U72#?secret=Nr0rrZ0ois\" data-secret=\"Nr0rrZ0ois\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Google is referring to the incoming extra capabilities users in Europe will gain as &#8220;Sovereign Controls for <span class=\"il\">Google<\/span> Workspace&#8221; &#8212; in what also sounds like a conscious echo of a concept that EU lawmakers like to refer to as &#8220;digital sovereignty.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>EU lawmakers use that phrasing to talk about the region gaining autonomy over digital infrastructure &#8212; much of which is supplied by U.S. tech firms. But, here, Google looks to be trying to spin an alternative version of &#8216;sovereignty&#8217; by suggesting that technical measures and user configurations alone can provide enough autonomy for the EU, regardless of the tech itself still being supplied by a U.S. giant, in the hopes that customers in the bloc keep buying its tools.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;European organizations are moving their operations and data to the cloud in increasing numbers to enable collaboration, drive business value, and transition to hybrid work. However, the cloud solutions that underpin these powerful capabilities must meet an organization\u2019s critical requirements for security, privacy, and digital sovereignty. We often hear from European Union policymakers and business leaders that ensuring the sovereignty of their cloud data, through regionalization and additional controls over administrative access, is crucial in this evolving landscape,&#8221; it writes in the blog post.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Today, we\u2019re announcing Sovereign Controls for Google Workspace, which<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>will provide digital sovereignty capabilities for organizations, both in the public and private sector, to control, limit, and monitor transfers of data to and from the EU starting at the end of 2022, with additional capabilities delivered throughout 2023.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>This commitment builds on our existing Client-side encryption, Data regions, and Access Controls capabilities.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>What extra capabilities has Google announced now? In the near term, there looks to be an expansion of the client-side encryption which Google announced for Workspace <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/14\/google-opens-workspace-to-everyone\/\">last summer<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Organizations can choose to use Client-side encryption pervasively across all their users, or create rules that apply to specific users, organizational units, or shared drives,&#8221; says Google. &#8220;Client-side encryption is now generally available for Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides, with plans to extend the functionality to Gmail, Google Calendar, and Meet by the end of 2022.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Google is also announcing an expansion of data location controls &#8212; although its timeframe for this capability enhancement is slower, slated as coming &#8220;by the end of 2023.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Data regions already allow our customers to control the storage location of their covered data at-rest,&#8221; it writes, adding: &#8220;We will enhance this capability by the end of 2023 through expanded coverage of data storage and processing in-region along with an in-country copy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There will also be more access controls &#8212; to meet what Google couches as &#8220;evolving digital sovereignty standards.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It says these incoming access controls will enable customers to:<u><\/u><u><\/u><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Restrict and\/or approve Google support access through Access Approvals.<u><\/u><\/li>\n<li>Limit customer support to EU-based support staff through Access Management.<\/li>\n<li>Ensure round-the-clock support from Google Engineering staff, when needed, with remote-in virtual desktop infrastructure.<u><\/u><\/li>\n<li>Generate &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; log reports on data access and actions through the Access Transparency function.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But, again, these extra controls are not coming until the end of 2023.<\/p>\n<p>Google is not starting from scratch here &#8212; having trailed incoming &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/blog\/products\/identity-security\/new-sovereign-controls-for-gcp-via-assured-workloads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data sovereignty controls<\/a>&#8221; for EU users last fall, when it also talked about offering cloud services on &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/blog\/products\/identity-security\/helping-build-the-digital-future-on-europes-terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Europe&#8217;s terms.<\/a>&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Although it will, of course, be for the bloc&#8217;s regulators to judge whether what it offers meets the required legal standard for the data flows in question to, er, legally flow.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"7ubVI374Cc\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/10\/cnil-google-analytics-gdpr-breach\/\">France&#8217;s privacy watchdog latest to find Google Analytics breaches GDPR<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;France&#8217;s privacy watchdog latest to find Google Analytics breaches GDPR&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/10\/cnil-google-analytics-gdpr-breach\/embed\/#?secret=8JXpjPbVU1#?secret=7ubVI374Cc\" data-secret=\"7ubVI374Cc\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Google generally argues that hybrid working complicates a legal requirement to &#8220;retain control of data wherever it resides&#8221; &#8212; before suggesting its approach, of &#8220;cloud-native architecture&#8221; (it specifies that Google Workspace &#8220;functions fully within a browser, without requiring caches or installed software on employee devices&#8221;) combined with a context-aware (&#8220;zero-trust&#8221;) approach to security which works by geofencing users and devices, plus controls for admins to let them set sharing boundaries and define rules that govern user communication, can help its customers navigate these choppy legal waters while still allowing the software&#8217;s core collaborative functions to work.<\/p>\n<p>Use in the EU of cloud services from U.S.-based companies has been shrouded in legal uncertainty for a number of years &#8212; most recently since <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/16\/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism\/\">July 2020<\/a> when the bloc&#8217;s top court struck down the flagship EU-U.S. Privacy Shield data transfer agreement over a fatal clash between U.S. surveillance law and EU privacy rights.<\/p>\n<p>For the four years it stood, Privacy Shield simplified EU to U.S. data exports with a self-certification system to authorize exports of Europeans&#8217; personal data. But that regime ended with the July 2020 CJEU strike down.<\/p>\n<p>And while the court did not outlaw data exports entirely, it did crank up the complexity of using other transfer mechanisms (such as standard contractual clauses) &#8212; making it clear that regional data protection agencies have a duty to step in and suspend data transfers if they believe European&#8217;s information is flowing to a destination where it&#8217;s at risk. (The EDPB subsequently put out <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/22\/eu-puts-out-final-guidance-on-data-transfers-to-third-countries\/\">guidance<\/a> on so-called &#8216;supplementary measures&#8217; that may help raise the standard of protection, such as robust encryption.)<\/p>\n<p>The fact of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield being struck down by the CJEU made it plain that the U.S. is a risky destination for EU data &#8212; hence <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/17\/clouds-gather-over-us-cloud-services-after-cjeu-ruling\/\">U.S.-based cloud services have been in the frame ever since<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And while the court ruling was not immediately followed by orders to cease data flows, EU agencies have been stepping up action and enforcements on the data transfers issue in recent months. The European Data Protection Supervisor gave the European Parliament a smackdown <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/10\/edps-decision-european-parliament-covid-19-test-website\/\">at the start of this year<\/a> over a COVID-19 testing booking website (which used Google Analytics and included code for Stripe), for example.<\/p>\n<p>Other <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/10\/cnil-google-analytics-gdpr-breach\/\">subsequent<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/10\/cnil-google-analytics-gdpr-breach\/\">decisions<\/a> from data supervisors have similarly taken issue with use of certain Google&#8217;s tools.<\/p>\n<p>The CJEU ruling followed the 2013 Snowden disclosures by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden &#8212; who published details of U.S. government mass surveillance programs tapping commercial digital services &#8212; revelations which also led to the prior EU-U.S. data transfer deal, Safe Harbor, being <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/10\/06\/europes-top-court-strikes-down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s\/\">struck down in 2015<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/10\/06\/europes-top-court-strikes-down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s\/\">by an earlier legal challenge<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So, while the EU and the U.S. announced reaching a political agreement on a replacement for Privacy Shield <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/25\/eu-and-us-agree-data-transfer-deal-to-replace-defunct-privacy-shield\/\">this March<\/a>, a third attempt to bridge the same legal schism will undoubtedly face a fresh court challenge. And the odds that Privacy Shield 2.0 survives the CJEU&#8217;s assessment look fairly slender, failing substantial reform of U.S. surveillance law (which does not appear to be on the table).<\/p>\n<p>All of which makes Google&#8217;s strategy &#8212; of offering its customers in the EU an expanding bundle of technical and organizational measures (such as client-side encryption, data localization and other bespoke controls like EU-based tech support) &#8212; look like a reasoned attempt to find a way to securing and future-proofing critical business data flows in the eyes of EU regulators, regardless of any political deal on paper. (Although its blog post also notes that Google Cloud will be &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/blog\/products\/identity-security\/how-google-cloud-helps-eu-companies-under-new-data-transfer-rules\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/blog\/products\/identity-security\/how-google-cloud-helps-eu-companies-under-new-data-transfer-rules&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1651662269690000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3C-rXKfdOcYaQveSIc90jA\">making the protections<\/a>&#8221; offered by the new EU data transfer framework available &#8220;once it is implemented&#8221; (an event <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/12\/eu-us-data-transfers-deal-expected-timeline\/\">still likely multiple months away<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We remain committed to equipping our customers in Europe and across the globe with powerful technical solutions that help them adapt to and stay on top of a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape. We\u2019ve designed and built Google Workspace to operate on a secure foundation, providing capabilities to keep our users safe, their data secure and their information private. Digital sovereignty is core to our ongoing mission in Europe and elsewhere, and a guiding principle that customers can rely on now and into the future,&#8221; Google adds.<\/p>\n<p>Discussing the tech giant&#8217;s announcement, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lukOlejnik\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Lukasz Olejnik<\/a>, an independent cybersecurity researcher and consultant based in Europe, describes the latest development as &#8220;an interesting evolution of a product and service&#8221; which he assesses as almost certainly motivated by EU law and policy.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It appears to support directly the recommendations of EDPB, which also reflect my <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.lukaszolejnik.com\/technology-impact-of-privacy-shield-invalidation-is-it-the-eu-data-localization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">previous analysis<\/a>. Specifically the support for using specific technical and organizational setup,&#8221; he suggests. &#8220;As for the technical side, the processing is to be supported by client-side encryption, in ways that keys never leave the premises of an EU-located company. Client-side encryption capability is <a href=\"https:\/\/services.google.com\/fh\/files\/misc\/google-workspace-encryption-wp.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">already offered by Workspace<\/a>. Today, it could still be seen as a bit cumbersome &#8212; and it is unclear if the new controls would make anything easier. Let&#8217;s hope so. Still, it appears that what\u2019s new is this all-in-one control.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The expansion of in-country data centers is an expected development but an additional one that would support the ECJ judgment,&#8221; he also tells us, adding: &#8220;What\u2019s still lacking is an easy-to-use and usable management of access to data. Like the data in Google Docs. For example, today it is far from simple to easily list all the shared documents, to remove some sharing configuration. To expect people to do this file after file, for individual files, is far from usable at a scale. This should be simplified, not on an individual file basis. It seems that &#8212; maybe! &#8212; the new Access Control capability may offer help here? How it works in practice remains to be seen.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"JHL1eWAGRP\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/16\/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism\/\">Europe&#8217;s top court strikes down flagship EU-US data transfer mechanism<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Europe&#8217;s top court strikes down flagship EU-US data transfer mechanism&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/16\/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism\/embed\/#?secret=lzFPmYatYB#?secret=JHL1eWAGRP\" data-secret=\"JHL1eWAGRP\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"iUeyx7gK5t\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/22\/eu-puts-out-final-guidance-on-data-transfers-to-third-countries\/\">EU puts out final guidance on data transfers to third countries<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;EU puts out final guidance on data transfers to third countries&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/22\/eu-puts-out-final-guidance-on-data-transfers-to-third-countries\/embed\/#?secret=zIgDvy3e0D#?secret=iUeyx7gK5t\" data-secret=\"iUeyx7gK5t\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google has announced a package of additional controls for users of its productivity suite, Google Workspace (ne\u00e9 G Suite), in Europe &#8212; which it&#8217;s rolling out by the end of this year and next.

There&#8217;s an app for that&#8230; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yayzen.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zen<\/a> uses posture mirroring software to help information workers stop hunching over their desks &#8212; sending alerts when it detects you&#8217;re not sitting up straight so you can correct your posture and, hopefully, avoid a lifetime of back problems.<\/p>\n<p>The catch? It uses your webcam to check on your posture. So, er, you have to be comfortable with Zen&#8217;s software &#8216;watching&#8217; through the lens as you work.<\/p>\n<p>Given how many people routinely tape over their webcam <em>just to be sure<\/em> &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2014\/03\/webcams-mics\/\">y&#8217;know, that the NSA isn&#8217;t watching<\/a> &#8212; that&#8217;s quite the ask. So we asked Zen&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, Daniel James, how the San Francisco-based startup works around that privacy concern.<\/p>\n<p>As well as offering the tool direct to consumers (it currently has 1,000+ users of its subscription service), the startup sells a version of Zen to employers and has signed up around 30 companies (including over a dozen enterprises) since it launched the offering back in October 2020. And given rocketing growth in worker surveillance tools since the pandemic-triggered boom in remote working there&#8217;s plenty of reason for privacy concerns.<\/p>\n<p>For example, could an employer that&#8217;s signed up to Zen use the tool, if not literally to spy on staff sitting at their desks (which would probably be pretty boring tbh), then to log how many hours they are physically sat in front of the screen, say &#8212; and use those data-points to pressure employees to shorten any desk breaks they might wish to take?<\/p>\n<p>Dystopian uses of webcam-based tools aren&#8217;t hard to imagine because such stuff, sadly, isn&#8217;t science fiction. Take Amazon&#8217;s launch in the US last year of AI-powered cameras in its Prime delivery vans, which it said would be used to assess driver &#8220;safety&#8221; &#8212; but which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-55938494\">critics instantly dubbed Orwellian surveillance<\/a>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>In short, &#8216;AIs with eyes&#8217; can just feel, er, function <em>creepy<\/em>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Zen says it&#8217;s taken a &#8220;privacy centric&#8221; approach to building this webcam-based posture correcting tech &#8212; meaning its taken some specific steps to try to reassure users they&#8217;re not being watched by it or anyone else as the AI watches them.<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, its posture correction software is open source (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/tensorflow\/tfjs-models\/tree\/master\/posenet\">the code is here on Github<\/a>). &#8220;We use open source software for the entire app, except our exercise and educational content, which we custom make,&#8221; notes James when as asked about that.<\/p>\n<p>The AI also processes data locally, on device &#8212; which means it does not require an internet connection to function &#8212; so he says users can verify for themselves that it&#8217;s not uploading\/streaming any data to the cloud by testing it with their wi-fi\/internet connection disabled.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The posture correction software feature runs offline, without internet, without recording or storing visuals,&#8221; he emphasizes. &#8220;Since data, like photos or videos, can&#8217;t be passed to the cloud without internet connection, which is the only way that employers could spy on employees, it&#8217;s technically impossible for us (Zen) or employers to record or store any visuals and ultimately spy on people.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He also confirms that employers who use Zen&#8217;s software only receive &#8220;aggregated&#8221; (entire company) and &#8220;anonymous&#8221; (no individual names) information on how many employees sign up to the app and how many use it on a weekly basis.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;With these two data points they can see if employees are engaged with Zen or not, which is usually the determining factor for them when deciding to extend their contract with us,&#8221; he adds.<\/p>\n<p>So &#8212; to be clear &#8212; Zen&#8217;s claim is that neither employers who pay it for the software (or Zen itself) can access the camera feed of users to record or store any visuals.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The posture correction feature of the app, which is the only feature that accesses individuals&#8217; cameras doesn&#8217;t run on the cloud, which technically means that no one can tap into the app and access data, including visuals,&#8221; says James, adding: &#8220;Surprisingly, no employer has ever asked for &#8216;spy&#8217; type data. They really just want to know if employees are using the solution that they are paying for.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Even so, privacy conscious desk workers may still<em> not like<\/em> the idea of sitting in front of a naked camera lens all day.<\/p>\n<p>After all, there is little in tech so blissfully out-of-sight-out-of-mind as a webcam with a sticker stuck firmly over it.<\/p>\n<h2>Posture check-ins<\/h2>\n<div>\n<p>On this, James suggests Zen users have come up with their own way to feel comfortable with the tool as he says they tend to use the app to do short posture checks in &#8212; say of 30 minutes or an hour with the feature enabled, a couple of times a day &#8212; rather than keeping it on all the time.<\/p>\n<p>The developers have smartly leaned into that &#8212; recommending users do just a short daily check in to stay posture aware.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We noticed that the majority of our users don&#8217;t leave Zen on all day. Instead they do a short 30-60 minute posture session during their first work session in the morning and another one around Noon or 4 PM. This correlates to how most people meditate,&#8221; James tells TechCrunch. &#8220;They spend a short time actively being aware of their thoughts which strengthens their passive awareness throughout the day. This works for posture as well.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Doing short small sessions daily ultimately increases your posture awareness and behavior change. Furthermore, in user interviews people often tell us that &#8216;Zen seems to be in the back of my head even when I&#8217;m not at my desktop. I find myself slouching at the dinner table, and I&#8217;m starting to naturally notice it and move back into an upright position.&#8217; From this anecdotal and analytical data, we decided to recommend people to start using the app for just thirty minutes a day during what we call the &#8216;7-Day Posture Challenge&#8217; and people are seeing amazing results both in increased posture awareness and decreased back and joint pain.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve found that people aren&#8217;t as concerned about any privacy invasions when they realize that Zen doesn&#8217;t have to be on all day. You can turn it on and off as you wish,&#8221; he adds.<\/p>\n<p>James also says users often combine use of the posture monitoring feature with use of other apps which require the webcam to be on, such as when they&#8217;re making a videoconferencing call.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They can show posture awareness and confidence during their video calls and they have their camera on for Zoom and G Meets regardless so they aren&#8217;t as concerned about any privacy invasions,&#8221; he notes.<\/p>\n<p>Zen integrates with the user&#8217;s general computer workflow &#8212; running in the background and mirroring the user&#8217;s posture via a stick-man icon displayed in the menu bar which lets users keep discreet tabs without being interrupted with alert messages. Blue and upright is good; bent and red is bad. (James says it never sends distracting\/pop-up message alerts; but users can choose from a few options how they want to be alerted.)<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2309566\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2309566\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2309566\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Visual-4-Core-Feature.gif?w=680\" alt=\"Zen's posture correction app\" width=\"680\" height=\"420\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2309566\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">How Zen alerts users to poor posture: A larger graphic can be pinned to the screen (with an optional alarm feature) or users can rely on watching a discreet stick-man in the menu bar can (Credit: Zen)<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The posture correcting AI works off a user-defined baseline &#8212; meaning the user needs to demonstrate their upright posture on set up. The app then uses that to build a user-specific model made of vectors that record key posture points\/indictors (joints, nose, ears etc) so the AI can detect posture changes in real-time (i.e. when the camera monitoring is enabled) and determine whether or not the person is slouching.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;These posture points are fed to a mathematical model that constantly compares your current posture position to the original baseline posture position that you set as your &#8216;upright&#8217; position,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;In addition, the app applies geometrical formulas to vectors formed by your current posture position and your original baseline upright posture position to determine if you&#8217;re slouching.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>James has a personal reason to be keen on keeping good posture, having been a &#8220;very active&#8221; NCAA Division-One college football player at Yale University who then went on to working at Adobe in San Francisco &#8212; and &#8220;living the typical sedentary corporate lifestyle of sitting in front of a computer for over eight hours a day&#8221; &#8212; which eventually led to him developing serious low back pain and carpal tunnel.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Adobe offered great ergonomic resources like a free ergonomic consultation and a stand-up desk and purchased different devices that claimed to help with posture but my pain just continued to increase,&#8221; he says, fleshing out the reasons that led to founding Zen.<\/p>\n<p>There was a lucky strike too: His co-founder, Alex Secara &#8212; who was his housemate at the time and is now Zen&#8217;s CTO &#8212; had already developed a posture correction software for himself in college to help with a spine-related condition he has (kyphosis) which had also been exacerbated after long hours of coding during tech internships.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2311805\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2311805\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2311805\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/IMG_0483-rotated.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"Zen co-founders\" width=\"680\" height=\"510\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/IMG_0483-rotated.jpeg 4032w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/IMG_0483-rotated.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/IMG_0483-rotated.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/IMG_0483-rotated.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/IMG_0483-rotated.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/IMG_0483-rotated.jpeg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/IMG_0483-rotated.jpeg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/IMG_0483-rotated.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2311805\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Zen&#8217;s co-founders, CTO Alex Secara (L) and CEO Daniel James (Image credits: Zen)<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We ultimately decided to join forces to build Zen alongside top ergonomists and physical therapists,&#8221; adds James.<\/p>\n<p>Zen is disclosing $3.5M in pre-seed funding raised from investors including Y Combinator, Valor Equity Partners, Goodwater Capital, Samsung Next, Softbank and others which it says it will be using to invest in expanding its team for growth and product dev &#8212; with plans in the works for key workday integrations (Slack, G Cal, Microsoft Teams), and for versions of the software for different devices\/platforms (mobile, tablet, etc.).<\/p>\n<p>The startup also tells us says it&#8217;s exploring partnerships with larger companies and &#8220;further proving out the efficacy of our solutions through clinical studies&#8221;.

top court unblocks more GDPR litigation against Big Tech"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A ruling by the European Union&#8217;s top court today is set to unblock a raft of litigation brought by consumer protection organizations seeking to apply the bloc&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) standard against tech giants such as Facebook and Twitter over issues like whether they gather properly informed consent to process people&#8217;s data.<\/p>\n<p>In a judgment today, the Court of Justice (CJEU) affirmed that consumer protection organizations can bring representative actions against infringements of the bloc&#8217;s laws protecting people&#8217;s data under GDPR.<\/p>\n<p>The referral to the CJEU came from a German court in a case brought against Meta (Facebook) by the German Federal Union of Consumer Organisations and Associations (aka the vzbv) relating to the ToS of certain free games apps running on its platform which force consent from users by not providing them with an option to decline processing if they play the game.<\/p>\n<p>In a brief response statement, a Meta spokesperson said: \u201cThe underlying legal proceedings showed that there were some open questions, which the CJEU has now addressed. We will review the decision and assess its implications.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The CJEU ruling prefigures a wider change &#8212; coming to EU next year, when the Representative Actions Directive come into application in June &#8212; which will further expand the ability of consumer rights groups to litigate on behalf of individuals whose rights they believe are being violated.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;By today\u2019s judgment, the Court finds that the GDPR does not preclude national legislation which allows a consumer protection association to bring legal proceedings, in the absence of a mandate conferred on it for that purpose and independently of the infringement of specific rights of the data subjects, against the person allegedly responsible for an infringement of the laws protecting personal data, on the basis of the infringement of the prohibition of unfair commercial practices, a breach of a consumer protection law or the prohibition of the use of invalid general terms and conditions, where the data processing concerned is liable to affect the rights that identified or identifiable natural persons derive from that regulation,&#8221; the court writes in a press release.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"joSed0eGY7\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/27\/facebook-leaked-ads-document-meta-gdpr\/\">Leaked Facebook ads document raises fresh questions over GDPR enforcement<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Leaked Facebook ads document raises fresh questions over GDPR enforcement&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/27\/facebook-leaked-ads-document-meta-gdpr\/embed\/#?secret=KmKQNCEu3D#?secret=joSed0eGY7\" data-secret=\"joSed0eGY7\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Tech giants have typically tried to derail these kinds of privacy suits by arguing national courts do not have jurisdiction under the GDPR &#8212; which is intended to harmonize national legislation in this area. It also contains a mechanism (the one-stop-shop; OSS), which funnels cross-border GDPR complaints through a lead data protection agency in the EU Member State where each entity locates their regional HQ (for many most tech giants that means Ireland).<\/p>\n<p>EU lawmakers included the OSS to simplify compliance for businesses. But its existence has supercharged the anti-consumer-rights practice of forum shopping &#8212; whereby corporate giants flock together around &#8216;friendly&#8217; regulators, piling on pressure at a political level &#8212; say, by touting the local jobs and wealth their presence creates &#8212; to encourage oversight that aligns with their commercial interests.<\/p>\n<p>The tactic also effectively shrinks the resources of the regulator by piling on complex case work.<\/p>\n<p>All these pressures can and have contributed to GDPR enforcement bottlenecks, delays in decisions and even investigations being dropped or never opened in the first place. And complaints over this recently led to an investigation being opened into the European Commission&#8217;s monitoring of the GDPR&#8217;s application by the EU&#8217;s ombudsperson.<\/p>\n<p>In Facebook&#8217;s case, oversight by Ireland has led to the equivalent of a total freeze on enforcement &#8212; as the service has not been hit with a single final GDPR decision since the regulation came into application in May 2018, despite myriad complaints (some of which now date back almost four years).<\/p>\n<p>Ireland did finally produce <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/02\/whatsapp-faces-267m-fine-for-breaching-europes-gdpr\/\">a decision on a complaint against Facebook-owned WhatsApp last year<\/a>. But scores more complaints continue to languish &#8212; and only today the European privacy rights group, noyb, announced that the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) had settled with it over what it described as a &#8220;gross delay&#8221; in two cases related to Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp which it also said will see Irish taxpayers footing a legal bill of several tens of thousands of euros.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Forty-seven months after the filing of the cases on Facebook&#8217;s &#8216;consent bypass,&#8217; the DPC agreed to pay tens of thousands in costs for a Judicial Review over delays,&#8221; noyb wrote in a press release. &#8220;While the GDPR requires a decision &#8216;without delay&#8217; the DPC takes the view that four years for producing a draft decision is reasonable. In most EU Member States the law requires a decision within three to 12 months.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Noyb&#8217;s press release offers an eye-tickling visual metaphor for forum shopping &#8212; illustrating the latest painstaking development in the never-ending regulatory saga <a href=\"https:\/\/noyb.eu\/en\/irish-dpc-burns-taxpayer-money-over-delay-cases\">with a picture of a snail crawling over a pile of money<\/a>. (In case it wasn&#8217;t clear, the snail is Ireland&#8217;s DPC; not pictured: Facebook holding everyone&#8217;s data and laughing all the way to the bank.)<\/p>\n<p>This embarrassing GDPR enforcement bottleneck continues to take the shine off the EU&#8217;s flagship data protection regulation &#8212; making it extremely hard for individuals to exercise their rights against the most powerful tech platforms.<\/p>\n<p>That in turn means that any avenues which open up the possibility of more litigation against big tech &#8212; and today&#8217;s ruling is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/15\/cjeu-ruling-could-open-big-tech-to-more-privacy-litigation-in-europe\/\">not the first such CJEU judgement<\/a> &#8212; are important to resetting the power imbalance between platform giants and individual web users. Although the pan-EU change coming next year &#8212; via application of the Representative Actions Directive &#8212; should unlock more actions as that legislation will not rely on the procedure in question existing at a national level.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, in a note on its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vzbv.de\/urteile\/datenschutzverstoesse-von-meta-und-co-eugh-bestaetigt-weitreichende-dsgvo-klagebefugnis-von\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website<\/a> (which we&#8217;ve translate from German), the vzbv calls the CJEU decision a &#8220;landmark ruling,&#8221; saying it means the Federal Court of Justice is &#8220;on the train again.&#8221; The consumer group has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/13\/german-court-finds-fault-with-facebooks-default-privacy-settings\/\">spent years trying to litigate against Facebook<\/a> in areas like unfair privacy settings, while Meta&#8217;s lawyers have giving it the runaround, arguing against local courts having any jurisdiction to hear the challenges.<\/p>\n<p>In the statement, Jutta Gurkmann, board member of the vzbv, added that today&#8217;s CJEU ruling &#8220;puts an end to the tiresome debate about consumer associations&#8217; right to sue for data protection.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It is an open secret that some European data protection authorities are not quite able to cope with the escalating data collection of the big technology companies,&#8221; she also said, adding: &#8220;In the past, this enforcement deficit increasingly gnawed at the acceptance of the GDPR.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Now it is clear: In addition to the supervisory authorities, civil society organizations such as the vzbv can also punish violations of the GDPR to a very large extent. The vzbv has been successfully and efficiently suing Meta, Google and Co. for a long time. Today&#8217;s ECJ judgment creates legal certainty until the European Class Actions Directive to be implemented this year, which also contains such a power.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Also commenting on the CJEU ruling in a statement, Ursula Pachl, deputy director general of the European consumer organization, BEUC, welcomed it as &#8220;good news,&#8221; while underscoring the importance of the looming June 2023 pan-EU directive.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s ruling is good news because it underlines that consumer groups can file collective claims against companies like Meta in case of a breach of the GDPR, as long as this procedure exists at national level. The GDPR is a crucial law that protects people\u2019s personal data in the EU. It is essential that it is better enforced, and rulings like today\u2019s will help,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs of next year, new EU rules will allow consumer groups to launch representative actions, which will further improve the situation. It will then be possible for consumer associations in all EU countries, as long as they meet certain criteria, to launch injunctions or collective redress claims against companies that break the law, including under the GDPR. A new era in enforcement by consumer groups will then begin.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"rui5Dn8pCe\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/15\/cjeu-ruling-could-open-big-tech-to-more-privacy-litigation-in-europe\/\">CJEU ruling could open big tech to more privacy litigation in Europe<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;CJEU ruling could open big tech to more privacy litigation in Europe&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/15\/cjeu-ruling-could-open-big-tech-to-more-privacy-litigation-in-europe\/embed\/#?secret=tPbWCvy4BV#?secret=rui5Dn8pCe\" data-secret=\"rui5Dn8pCe\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"jTtY7xWgrB\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/24\/facebooks-dodgy-defaults-face-more-scrutiny-in-europe\/\">Facebook&#8217;s dodgy defaults face more scrutiny in Europe<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook&#8217;s dodgy defaults face more scrutiny in Europe&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/24\/facebooks-dodgy-defaults-face-more-scrutiny-in-europe\/embed\/#?secret=nnxyb2rlIF#?secret=jTtY7xWgrB\" data-secret=\"jTtY7xWgrB\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A ruling by the European Union&#8217;s top court today is set to unblock a raft of litigation brought by consumer protection organizations seeking to apply the bloc&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) standard against tech giants such as Facebook and Twitter over issues like whether they gather properly informed consent to process people&#8217;s data.

that&#8217;s sometimes referred to as the &#8216;Google of Russia,&#8217; has signed a term sheet to sell its media division to VKontakte (VK), aka the <a

a term sheet to divest its news aggregator (News) and blogging\/infotainment platform (Zen) with VK today. But it declined to provide further detail on the transaction that&#8217;s been agreed with VK, including financial terms.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/ir.yandex\/press-releases?year=2022&amp;id=2022-28-04\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement<\/a> the Russian Internet group, which is registered in the Netherlands for tax purposes, said its main Russian operating subsidiary, Yandex LLC, has<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> reached an agreement in principle With VK Group on the sale of News and Zen.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;While the parties have come to an agreement in principle on a transaction, they are continuing to discuss technical and financial details, which will be announced in due course,&#8221; Yandex added, further noting that the transaction is subject to (and still pending) the approval of Russian&#8217;s antimonopoly regulator, FAS.<\/p>\n<p>As well as needing regulatory approval for the sale to go ahead, Yandex&#8217;s investors will also need to agree to the deal terms.<\/p>\n<p>The development confirms TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/16\/russia-yandex-news-vk\/\">reporting last month<\/a>: Our sources named VK as the leading contender to acquire Yandex&#8217;s media assets as the latter looked for an exit on rising risk in the wake of Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine and the Kremlin&#8217;s tightening its grip on freedom of expression.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/18\/russian-search-giant-yandex-tells-investors-its-looking-for-a-media-exit\/\">Shortly after<\/a> reports of a potential sale of News and Zen began to circulate, Yandex told investors it was exploring strategic options for its media products &#8212; saying it was potentially looking to sell its News aggregator and blogging &#8216;infotainment&#8217; recommender platform, Zen.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Last month the EU sanctioned a key Yandex executive, Tigran Khudaverdyan &#8212; citing accusations by a former head of its news operation over the role it plays in spreading Kremlin propaganda. It was quickly followed up by an announcement from Yandex that Khudaverdyan was stepping down as the deputy CEO and executive member of the board of Yandex NV, its Netherlands-based parent.<\/p>\n<p>The latter is publicly traded on Nasdaq but trading of Yandex&#8217;s stock was halted at the end of February after it had shed more than half its value in five days.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"elG0AD8XB0\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/18\/russian-search-giant-yandex-tells-investors-its-looking-for-a-media-exit\/\">Russian search giant Yandex tells investors it&#8217;s looking for a media exit<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Russian search giant Yandex tells investors it&#8217;s looking for a media exit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/18\/russian-search-giant-yandex-tells-investors-its-looking-for-a-media-exit\/embed\/#?secret=ngVpNg2UAX#?secret=elG0AD8XB0\" data-secret=\"elG0AD8XB0\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>While there&#8217;s no word on how much VK has agreed to pay to buy the two media products, the social media and services group reported issues with servicing its own debt <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/russian-london-listed-internet-firm-vk-flags-issues-with-servicing-debt-2022-03-15\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">last month<\/a> &#8212; saying it may not have enough liquidity to pay its debt holders if most of them demand their redemption rights on a $400 million bond, citing uncertainty around the impact of sanctions on Russia. So it&#8217;s possible that the deal to acquire News and Zen is being done as an asset swap, rather than a cash transfer.<\/p>\n<p>VK is known outside Russia for its eponymous Facebook-esque social networking platform but the company has expanded into many other tech-enabled lines of business including productivity, gaming, marketplaces, food delivery, transport, recruitment, payment processing and even its own hardware with a baked in AI assistant.<\/p>\n<p>If the acquisition were to be an asset swap there are a number of options that might be attractive to Yandex, which also operates a number of areas beyond web search and ads &#8212; from e-commerce and video streaming to food delivery and ride hailing.<\/p>\n<p>That said, Yandex is also dealing with a revenue crunch as sanctions aimed at Russia&#8217;s economy take their toll.<\/p>\n<p>While the business itself has not been sanctioned, it is not insulated from the wider economic crisis hitting its home market and withdrew its 2022 financial guidance a week ago.<\/p>\n<p>Reporting its Q1 earnings yesterday, Yandex revealed an adjusted net loss of 8.1 billion roubles ($110 million), via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/russian-internet-group-yandex-reports-110-mln-net-loss-q1-2022-04-27\/\">Reuters<\/a>. Only five weeks of the quarter overlapped with Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, which means that Yandex&#8217;s Q2 earnings will show a fuller picture of how it&#8217;s being affected by what its earnings note dryly refers to as &#8220;geopolitical developments.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Yandex&#8217;s Q1 loss stems from rising operating expenses &#8212; with the bulk coming from increases in payments to staff, per the earnings report. It said it paid this extra salary to all its employees (nearly 20,000 people) in the form of one-off support payments (costing a total of ~5,9 million roubles) to help staff deal with economic turmoil since the war began.<\/p>\n<p>If the transaction to sell News and Zen goes through, Yandex&#8217;s media exit is likely to further shrink its revenue.<\/p>\n<p>A paragraph on financial outlook in the earnings report warns of &#8220;high&#8221; uncertainty affecting its ability to provide forward guidance to investors:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Given the significant changes to the external environment and the high degree of uncertainty concerning future geopolitical developments (including risk of further sanctions and their impact on the Russian and global economy), our visibility over the short- and medium-term is limited.

But, at that time, he says there were pressures on the business following the death of one of its founders &#8212; which meant its focus shifted to economic considerations since &#8220;we were facing a big crisis of understanding how to grow.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Years earlier, the developer-heavy company had been driven by the excitement of launching products and exploring what could be done with the internet, as he tells it.<\/p>\n<p>It was also a time when Russia felt relatively free &#8212; with journalism and media inside the country on the rise &#8212; and with the Kremlin, apparently, not yet having taken a keen interest in how online content could be shaped to feed its agenda.<\/p>\n<p>But, gradually, that began to change.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Yandex got some attention from the Russia government in 2006 \u2026 when the presidential administration asked Yandex to build a special service (president.yandex.ru),&#8221; says Bakunov, explaining that this collected questions from an internet audience, aggregated them and showed &#8220;only the most popular.&#8221; &#8220;We collected more than a million questions and I believe that was the start of the understanding of the Internet&#8217;s growing force. After that the interest from the administration grew slowly but inevitably,&#8221; he suggests.<\/p>\n<p>Another instance he recounts is the launch by Yandex, around 2010, of a search and rating service for blogs. Political bloggers started to compete to win this rating, though he says Yandex missed the significance of that, noting now: &#8220;At least half of them (as we know it now) were paid by the state.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>With the blogging ranking product being visibly gamed by state-funded bloggers &#8212; who were better resourced (by payments from the Kremlin) to get their content shared widely enough to rank higher on Yandex&#8217;s blog search rating &#8212; he says Yandex did decide to shut down the product.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;After that we got a lot of questions from different state structures such as the president&#8217;s administration,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;Now I understand it was because they use this instrument to check the status of political tension, and the position on rating was on KPI of the state&#8217;s bloggers. But it was the first time when we found that it&#8217;s really tough; we can&#8217;t just close the product.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Per Bakunov, the trigger for Yandex considering closing its main news aggregator service was after it had started adding a top five &#8220;top news&#8221; items to the news feed, based on an algorithmic assessment of popularity across news sources &#8212; when the company felt &#8220;a big pressure&#8221; in relation to what got lifted into that spotlight.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At this time, I believe Yandex was a top 1 to top 3 source of information &#8212; at least for young people (up to 40 years old),&#8221; he notes. But he says employees still felt they could workaround the Kremlin pressure by making sure independent news sources were included in the mix. &#8220;That was a turning point but the team who built the product decided &#8216;we can balance between the state and non-state sources of news.&#8217; The idea was \u2026 to show [a spectrum] of information.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At this point I believe there was a possibility to close it down,&#8221; says Bakunov, suggesting a strategy which might have worked could have been to remove &#8216;top news&#8217; from the main page &#8212; creating a small enough &#8220;scandal&#8221; for the company to get away with &#8212; after which they could have slowly decreased its popularity and let it fade away. But it seems the engineers were, ultimately, unwilling.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Tbh, I think it [would have been] so painful for the team to kill their own product,&#8221; he suggests.<\/p>\n<p>That left the Kremlin free to complete its &#8216;virtual takeover&#8217; of the algorithmic feed &#8212; by, in 2017, passing a law that news aggregators could only use state-approved sites as news sources.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That was not the start but the result of the government&#8217;s research on how to push their news on top Russian news sites and aggregators,&#8221; says Bakunov. &#8220;The algorithm inside Yandex News counts every news source as equal to each other, no matter how big it is. So the state&#8217;s people start to manipulate the Top News by pushing the important (for them) information to all state controlled news (especially regional).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I remember the discussion at the end of Spring 2017 about the shame of Yandex News&#8217; current status. We thought what if we just pull the trigger and turn it off?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>By then it was already too late. Bakunov says Yandex&#8217;s board of directors included Kremlin supporters who told it the state would not allow News to be shut down. If the company had gone ahead and done that anyway, he says the Kremlin would have quickly replaced the &#8220;culprit&#8221; who took the decision with &#8220;the proper man&#8221; who would order the product restored.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;So, yes, by 2017 it was too late. Even if someone &#8212; say &#8216;Arkady&#8217; who was a CEO of the company &#8212;\u00a0 had turned off the News, after a short time the trigger will be turned back on again, just with another team.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Look at VK Group,&#8221; Bakunov adds, pointing to the buyer that&#8217;s now been lined up to take over Yandex News. &#8220;It&#8217;s already happened to them. Now it&#8217;s just 100% state controlled company.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"JK148dwcEI\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/16\/russia-yandex-news-vk\/\">Russia&#8217;s war hits Yandex, the &#8216;Google of Russia&#8217;<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Russia&#8217;s war hits Yandex, the &#8216;Google of Russia&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/16\/russia-yandex-news-vk\/embed\/#?secret=6gZnjRmNXb#?secret=JK148dwcEI\" data-secret=\"JK148dwcEI\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"eHmCAw2ypG\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/14\/navalny-anti-war-ads\/\">Kremlin critic Navalny calls for Google and Meta to turn their adtech into an anti-war weapon<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Kremlin critic Navalny calls for Google and Meta to turn their adtech into an anti-war weapon&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/14\/navalny-anti-war-ads\/embed\/#?secret=1VVZtSjlJD#?secret=eHmCAw2ypG\" data-secret=\"eHmCAw2ypG\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In further fallout from Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, Yandex, the company that&#8217;s sometimes referred to as the &#8216;Google of Russia,&#8217; has signed a term sheet to sell its media division to VKontakte (VK), aka the local Facebook equivalent.

report on Facebook&#8217;s business yesterday that&#8217;s sure to raise fresh questions over the lack of enforcement of European privacy laws against the adtech giant.<\/p>\n<p>The report is based on a leaked internal document written last year by privacy engineers on its Ad and Business product team.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/21716382-facebook-data-lineage-internal-document\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">document<\/a>, which is entitled &#8220;ABP Privacy Infra, Long Range Investments [A\/C Priv],&#8221; appears to show engineers at the tech giant now known as Meta scratching their heads at the nightmarish task they&#8217;re facing: Trying to make Facebook&#8217;s data-ingesting ads business compliant with a &#8220;tsunami&#8221; of global privacy regulations that need it to know how user data flows through its systems so the company can apply policies that control what&#8217;s done with people&#8217;s information and perform basic stuff like reflect people&#8217;s privacy choices. So next time Sheryl Sandberg talks about Meta&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/28\/facebook-q2-earnings\/\">regulatory headwinds<\/a>&#8221; this is the contextual meat to graft on those euphemistic bones.<\/p>\n<p>Meta&#8217;s text deploys some internal business shorthand\/acronyms whose literal meanings aren&#8217;t always clear. But the gist of the read &#8212; and it&#8217;s worth reading in full if you can spare the time for 15-pages of text, diagrams and a few colorful analogies such as one comparing a person&#8217;s information to a bottle of ink being poured into a giant lake (oopsy!) &#8212; is that Meta has &#8216;designed&#8217; its ad system in such a totally unsiloed way that it&#8217;s very, very, <em>very<\/em> far from being able to comply with (even existing) laws like Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which has a purpose limitation principle meaning you need a legal basis for each use of personal data. Nor, per the document, do Meta&#8217;s engineers sound confident of being able to transform the mess and achieve timely compliance with a bunch of other, incoming global regulations either. (And don&#8217;t even get them started on what AI regulations might mean for the business.)<\/p>\n<p>Meta disputes that the document shows non-compliance with any privacy laws, of course.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement to Motherboard, the company claims the document &#8220;<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">does not describe our extensive processes and controls to comply with privacy regulations&#8221;; adding therefore that &#8220;it&#8217;s simply inaccurate to conclude that it demonstrates non-compliance&#8221;; and further claiming: &#8220;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">New privacy regulations across the globe introduce different requirements and this document reflects the technical solutions we are building to scale the current measures we have in place to manage data and meet our obligations.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">But, well, they would say that, wouldn&#8217;t they?\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Independent privacy researcher, Wolfie Christl &#8212; an <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/04\/on-metas-regulatory-headwinds-and-adtechs-privacy-reckoning\/\">expert in forensic analysis of ad data flows<\/a> &#8212; takes a different view of what the leaked document reveals &#8212; dubbing it &#8220;dynamite&#8221; and a &#8220;confession&#8221; (albeit one not intended by Meta for public consumption) that it does not comply with the GDPR.

A company can generally only collect personal data for a specified purpose. If a company cannot specify the purpose it collects personal data for, it is simply not allowed to process it under the GDPR.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Asked what Meta&#8217;s lead data protection regulator in the EU should do, Christl adds: &#8220;The Irish regulator must take action now. If Facebook cannot make clear how exactly its surveillance advertising machine uses personal data, it must be ordered to stop processing it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch contacted the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) to ask whether it will be opening an investigation into Meta&#8217;s ad data flows in light of what the document appears to show is, basically, an ads system that, either by design or systemic build creep, exists (or existed in 2021) in a state that&#8217;s antithetical to regulation &#8212; and, indeed, whether the document is of relevance to any of the (several) ongoing investigations it has into aspects of Facebook&#8217;s business.<\/p>\n<p>The regulator did not provide a statement but deputy commissioner Graham Doyle confirmed it had only seen the document for the first time when Motherboard\/Vice published it.<\/p>\n<p>That may raise further questions, given the DPC has &#8212; on paper &#8212; been investigating whether Facebook&#8217;s ads business complies with the GDPR&#8217;s requirement to have a valid legal basis for processing people&#8217;s data for almost four years now.<\/p>\n<p>For example, the DPC has been considering a complaint against Facebook, focused on its legal basis for processing user data for ads, since May 2018, when the regulation entered into force.<\/p>\n<p>A draft DPC decision on that inquiry, which was published (not by the DPC) <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/13\/irelands-draft-gdpr-decision-against-facebook-branded-a-joke\/\">last fall<\/a>, was quickly branded a joke by privacy campaigners as the regulator appeared to be intending to accept a tactic by Meta to evade the GDPR&#8217;s standard for consent-based processing by claiming a cunning contractual bypass.<\/p>\n<p>The tl;dr here is that for consent to be valid under the GDPR, data subjects must be given a free choice. Consent must also be purpose specific (aka no bundling); and it must be informed.<\/p>\n<p>None of which happens if you use Facebook &#8212; where the platform makes processing your information for ad targeting a condition of use. Click &#8216;agree to ads&#8217; or no Facebook account for you.<\/p>\n<p>But, per last year&#8217;s leaked draft DPC decision, Facebook claims users are actually<em> in a contract with it to receive targeted ads<\/em> &#8212; and the DPC didn&#8217;t appear to see reason to object to that GDPR-bypassing construction.<\/p>\n<p>Given GDPR complaints are still floundering on such legal basics, is it any wonder that the deep, dark, underbelly of Meta&#8217;s ad-targeting machinery contains, as this document tells it, a vast ocean of surveillance data on web users but so little apparatus to order this information according to people&#8217;s own wishes?<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line is that the EU is almost four years into enforcement of its &#8216;flagship&#8217; data protection regime and Facebook itself remains untouched by GDPR enforcement. (Its messaging platform WhatsApp was hit by a fine last year.)<\/p>\n<p>The European Union also didn&#8217;t suddenly invent privacy regulation in 2018, when the GDPR came into force. Before that law there was the Data Protection Directive, which included many of the same principles.<\/p>\n<p>So &#8212; in Europe at least &#8212; if a company like Facebook had actually been paying attention to legal requirements around privacy by design &#8212; and if EU regulators had been muscularly enforcing these long-standing rules &#8212; Meta might not now be warning investors about the &#8216;regulatory headwinds&#8217; coming for their shareholder value. Nor facing what sounds to be a monumentally expensive and resource intensive re-engineering challenge &#8212; not so much akin to landing on the moon as more like needing to reconstruct the whole of the planet from pulverized moondust in a way that ensures every tiny piece of rock and dust is put back in exactly the place it originated for. Oh, and &#8212; guess what! &#8212; the deadline for doing all that already passed. Call it the &#8216;Zuckerberg&#8217;s moonshot.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>A Meta spokesperson did not respond to a question asking whether, following the Motherboard report, it had contacted the DPC to provide its lead EU regulator with information on how its ads system functions.<\/p>\n<p>The company sent us the same statement it provided Motherboard earlier, which concludes with this lament: \u201cThis analogy lacks the context that we do, in fact, have extensive processes and controls to manage data and comply with privacy regulations.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The European Commission is ultimately responsible for monitoring the application of the GDPR by EU Member State agencies.<\/p>\n<p>We asked the Commission if it had any concerns in light of the leaked document and\/or a view on whether the DPC should open an investigation into Meta&#8217;s ads data flows. But at the time of writing it had not responded.<\/p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.siliconrepublic.com\/enterprise\/eu-ombudsman-inquiry-gdpr-ireland-commission-iccl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">February<\/a>, following a complaint against the Commission by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties &#8212; which accuses the EU&#8217;s executive of neglecting its duty to act on Ireland&#8217;s &#8220;failure to properly apply&#8221; the GDPR &#8212; the EU&#8217;s ombudsperson opened an inquiry &#8212; giving the Commission until May 15 to provide it with a \u201cdetailed and comprehensive\u201d account of the information it has collected so far around whether the regulation is applied \u201cin all respects\u201d in Ireland.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"r0kRT9DLoF\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/13\/irelands-draft-gdpr-decision-against-facebook-branded-a-joke\/\">Ireland&#8217;s draft GDPR decision against Facebook branded a joke<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Ireland&#8217;s draft GDPR decision against Facebook branded a joke&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/13\/irelands-draft-gdpr-decision-against-facebook-branded-a-joke\/embed\/#?secret=BiLXS9MxY5#?secret=r0kRT9DLoF\" data-secret=\"r0kRT9DLoF\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Motherboard\/Vice had an explosive report on Facebook&#8217;s business yesterday that&#8217;s sure to raise fresh questions over the lack of enforcement of European privacy laws against the adtech giant.

is bringing real-time data to the talent fight"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">UK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/ravio.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ravio <\/a>reckons real-time data is the best way to arm businesses to win the global talent war.<\/p>\n<p>Its new-to-market compensation benchmarking tool lets users see how the compensation (wages and benefits) they offer their own staff compares to the market by pooling data across its employer customers (data is anonymized at the platform level) &#8212; idea being to help them offer more competitive packages which help convince talent to sign on the dotted line.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Customers can explore market data and compare themselves to companies with similar characteristics such as location, industry, funding raised and headcount growth,&#8221; it writes of its SaaS platform in a press release accompanying the official launch today.<\/p>\n<p>The software also lets companies &#8220;identify compensation inequalities at individual, job type and company levels &#8212; and compare to peers in the market&#8221;, as it tells it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Whether it be gender, background or other criteria, this offers the most detailed diversity insights available to companies who want to make data-driven changes,&#8221; is another top-line claim.<\/p>\n<p>The startup, founded out of London, has been operating in stealth mode since starting building work on the platform in January, though it quietly opened up access a couple of weeks ago. (Research work and the idea itself dates back to last year.)<\/p>\n<p>It is now flipping on the light today for its official launch &#8212; and also announcing a total of <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$10 million in seed funding led by Northzone with participation from Cherry Ventures and Spark Capital.<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Ravio&#8217;s first target is fast growth scale-ups which are of course at the coal-face of the fight for talent. These high profile, high pressure startups are also often on the front line for diversity issues &#8212; where Ravio believes its SaaS tool will also provide valuable benchmarking.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Hiring and retention is the biggest challenge right now for scaleups due to war for talent, fast moving markets, (over)funding, the shift to remote work and &#8216;the great resignation&#8217;,&#8221; argues<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> co-CEO and co-founder, Raymond Siems<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There\u2019s a lot of clamour on closing pay and diversity gaps at startups but not many tangible numbers or practical solutions &#8212; it\u2019s mostly high level reports and talk.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">The follow-on goal for Ravio is to deepen its database by getting more scale-ups signed up &#8212; and, ultimately, it hopes to be able to expand the approach to other sectors. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">After all, notes Siems, there are talent shortages across all sorts of sectors &#8212; so a tool that supports businesses to make more attractive compensation offers could have broad utility, assuming the benchmarking insights live up to billing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re starting focused but the need for a solution is universal across industries and company sizes, it\u2019s not confined to the tech industry. We validated this during our research phase, with strong feedback from SMEs all the way up to large enterprises in other industries,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;High growth startups are the best place to start because they&#8217;re the least served by traditional benchmarking providers, and are feeling the talent crunch the most. Employee equity in private companies is one of the least transparent areas within compensation, so we&#8217;re tackling this early on.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;By having a focused approach we can build depth in our dataset, before expanding into other sectors.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ravio works by a sharing to participate model which means that organizations that want access to its jobs benchmarking data must agree to share info on their own teams, including salary data.<\/p>\n<p>The basic service is free but the team is building additional modules to layer on top that will be paid &#8212; so it&#8217;s taking a freemium approach to grease its data pipe.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We gather data from &#8216;source of truth&#8217; systems including the HRIS, ATS and cap table management software of our customers,&#8221; explains Siems. &#8220;We primarily connect via API, so there\u2019s no manual work for our customers in submitting and drawing together data, and this enables real-time updates rather than one-off static submissions &#8212; which are inefficient and hard to scale.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We currently support 28 HR systems which cover all the major players in Europe including Workday, Personio, BambooHR, HiBob and Namely,&#8221; he adds.<\/p>\n<p>Per Siems, Ravio&#8217;s automated, scalable data-pipeline approach is made possible because of widespread accessibility of employer data held in HR and other business systems via API &#8212; it just needs to convince employers to give it API access.<\/p>\n<p>He does not sound concerned that Ravio won&#8217;t get a critical enough mass of sign-ups to be able to generate genuinely <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">valuable compensation insights. <\/span>&#8220;We\u2019re set to expand quickly so the market coverage of our dataset will enable us to provide the most useful and granular insights available in Europe, and the only-real time information,&#8221; he responds to a question on how comprehensive a view of the market Ravio has at this stage, before reiterating that the benchmarking and compensation analytics product is free.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a self-service onboarding that can be done in 15 minutes &#8212; so it\u2019s as simple as possible for companies to join,&#8221; he adds.<\/p>\n<p>Siems also says Ravio is doing some of its own processing of the data it acquires from user companies so that it can extrapolate &#8220;beyond our market penetration&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>This &#8220;special sauce&#8221; incorporates &#8220;macro data to predict wider trends&#8221;, per Siems, who points to what he says is the most &#8220;sophisticated&#8221; compensation work currently being done &#8212; &#8220;by internal teams at big tech players like Meta&#8221; &#8212; as the team&#8217;s inspiration. He says Ravio has also hired people who have experience working on compensation for Big Tech firms including Amazon and Meta, as well as other multinationals like Coca-Cola.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They buy data from all of the major consultancies and then do their own data science work to build up a more detailed and comprehensive picture. We want to enable this depth and sophistication for companies of all sizes,&#8221; he says, adding:\u00a0&#8220;We\u2019re bringing a data science first approach into an area where there has been very little innovation, with a strong data science team from Cambridge and Oxford.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ravio isn&#8217;t disclosing the total number of scale-ups which signed up pre-launch but Siems, claims it&#8217;s already got a &#8220;healthy&#8221; list of customers who &#8220;heard about what we are building and wanted to join our testing phase&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Some of the names we\u2019re working with include unicorns Deliveroo, Truelayer, Flink, Zego and other high-growth European startups including Healx, Zoomo and Plum Guide,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>The paid version of the SaaS will be charged based on the number of employees the user has, according to Siems.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;We\u2019re charging for advanced features and two additional modules that we\u2019re releasing in the coming months: Manage and Communicate,&#8221; he notes, describing two of the premium products it has in the works<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">. &#8220;<\/span>Our Communicate module includes interactive offer letters for candidates, and a compensation portal for employees, to make it easier for them to understand every part of their package and their employer. This includes education on commonly misunderstood topics like equity and tax.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our Manage module provides a suite of tools to allow companies to manage compensation processes effortlessly. This includes organisation level budgeting and banding features, compensation review cycle management workflows, and growth scenario planning.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>On diversity, how &#8216;full spectrum&#8217; Ravio&#8217;s proposition can be is less clear &#8212; given Siems says the data available to it &#8220;varies by company&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;We\u2019re seeing the most commonly available data relates to gender, age, country of citizenship, marital status and ethnicity &#8212; but increasingly HR systems are supporting wider data fields such as disability status, so we\u2019ll be expanding our analytics as the data allows,&#8221; he says on that.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>While employers having better data on competitive rates of pay and broader compensation packages might be good for businesses to win talent, there is a question of whether this necessarily benefits employees &#8212; who aren&#8217;t being directly empowered to, for example, call out wage gaps inside their own organization, say if certain groups are being paid below market rates, since the tool looks intended for use by the HR department, rather than for general access.<\/p>\n<p>Asked about the risk of one-way real-time information disproportionately empowering employers, Ravio says: &#8220;We will be releasing market reports that are freely available &#8212; covering both compensation and diversity &#8212; that will empower both candidates and other employers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe that many of the current inequities in the market are not a result of bad intentions but rather the result of a lack of data,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;By becoming an objective source of information for employers in a notoriously opaque and difficult to understand space, Ravio\u2019s product will ultimately benefit employees by empowering companies to make unbiased decisions.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Flush with seed funding and post-official-launch, the team&#8217;s focus for the rest of this year is on growth in Europe &#8212; where Siems says they spy &#8220;huge opportunity&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;However the talent war is global so we will be quickly expanding our reach to new shores next year,&#8221; he adds, noting the startup has grabbed backing from a number of international investors. He also flags the experience of his co-founders, Roy Blanga and Merten Wulfert, in helping to rapidly scale Deliveroo, Groupon and HotelTonight internationally &#8212; claiming: &#8220;We\u2019re well positioned to execute on our vision.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>On the competitive front, Ravio&#8217;s view is &#8220;there\u2019s very little on the fairness and team analytics side&#8221; &#8212; with most of the action focused on compensation benchmarking. So it will presumably be weighting its offering there.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In some ways we are building a new age version of &#8216;salary surveys&#8217; and compensation benchmarking services offered by Radford, Towers Watson and Mercer (the big 3 players) which have been around for decades,&#8221; Siems suggests, adding:\u00a0&#8220;There is no one offering real-time data in Europe to our knowledge. Some new players are serving tech companies but only with static, manually collected data. In the US there are some new players and older static offerings like Option Impact.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It\u2019s also possible that HRIS players (e.g. Personio) will look to build their own version but with the market for HR tech being so fragmented &#8212; it will be tricky to get worthwhile breadth of data long term. The market is better structured for there to be a HRIS\/ATS\/Cap table agnostic player like us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Glassdoor does already pool user-contributed salary data &#8212; so can offer a snapshot of pay rates &#8212; but Siems believes Ravio is not directly competing since Glassdoor&#8217;s data is unverified, &#8220;patchy&#8221;, collected via one-off submissions and lacks enough breadth or depth to be useful to companies making compensation decisions.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Companies need comprehensive data,&#8221; he argues. &#8220;It also doesn\u2019t have access to information to enable team or fairness analytics.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Commenting on Ravio&#8217;s seed in a statement,\u00a0Michiel Kotting, partner at Northzone, said: \u201cWe see a huge market shift happening which is going to leave behind companies who don\u2019t modernise their approach around compensation. Winning companies will be transparent with compensation in the context of rising prices (inflation, cost of living, logistic costs) and a tighter talent market, especially in tech. Roy, Merten and Raymond are going after a problem that all companies big or small have, and are poised to build a leading company in the category.

Elon Musk put Twitter on a collision course with global speech regulators?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Elon Musk joked<\/span> earlier this month that he hoped buying Twitter won&#8217;t be <em>too<\/em> painful for him. But the self-proclaimed &#8220;free speech absolutist&#8221; may indeed be inviting a world of pain for himself (and his wallet) if he sets the platform on a collision course with the growing mass of legislation now being applied to social media services all around the world.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. lags far behind regions like Europe when it comes to digital rule-making. So Musk may simply not have noticed that the bloc just agreed on the fine details of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/23\/digital-services-act-political-deal-dsa\/\">the Digital Services Act<\/a> (DSA): A major reboot of platform rules that&#8217;s intended to harmonize governance procedures to ensure the swift removal of illegal speech, including by dialing up fines on so-called &#8220;very large online platforms&#8221; (aka, VLOPs; a classification that will likely apply to Twitter) to 6% of global annual turnover.<\/p>\n<p>On news of Musk&#8217;s winning bid for Twitter, EU lawmakers were swift to point out the hard limits coming down the pipe.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wait until <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@elonmusk<\/a> finds out that freedom of speech absolutionalists are also subject to (new) EU legislation to remove illegal content and make their platforms safe <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/DSA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DSA<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/B0MeZb1mDZ\">https:\/\/t.co\/B0MeZb1mDZ<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Paul Tang (@paultang) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/paultang\/status\/1518616092880654338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 25, 2022<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;The Commission can fine [non-compliant platforms] 6% of worldwide turnover,&#8221; emphasizes MEP Paul Tang, discussing why he believes the DSA will be able to rein in any more absolutist tendencies Musk may have.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Given the profit margin currently for Twitter that is a lot &#8212; because the net profit margin in negative, that&#8217;s the reason why he bought it in the first place I assume \u2026 It doesn&#8217;t make a profit and if it makes a profit it will be chipped away by the penalty. So he really has to find ways to make it more profitable to make sure that the company doesn&#8217;t lose money.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Tang also points out that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/21\/we-just-found-out-how-elon-musk-may-finance-his-43b-twitter-bid\/\">Musk&#8217;s $43 billion bid for Twitter is financed<\/a>, in large part, with loans &#8212; rather than him just cashing in Tesla equity to fully fund the bid, which means Musk is not as free to act on his impulses as he may otherwise have been.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in debt. He needs to pay his debts &#8212; his creditors \u2026 If he&#8217;d used all his equity to buy Twitter then he would have had more leeway, in a sense. He could take any loss he wants &#8212; up to a point, depending on the value of Tesla. But he&#8217;s in debt now, in this construction, so at least he has to pay for the interest &#8212; so the company needs to make a profit. And even more than before, I think.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It\u2019s 6% for every failure to comply. It would be an expensive hobby,&#8221; agrees MEP Alexandra Geese, dismissing the idea that the billionaire will just view any DSA fines as the equivalent of &#8220;parking tickets&#8221; to be picked off and flicked away.<\/p>\n<p>As well as headline fines of up to 6% for breaches of the regulation, repeated failures by a Musk-owned Twitter to comply with the DSA could lead to the European Commission issuing daily fines; suing him for non-compliance; or even ordering a regional block on the service.<\/p>\n<p>Article 41(3) of the regulation sets out powers in the event of repeated, serious infringements which &#8212; per snippets of the final text (still pending publication) we&#8217;ve seen &#8212; include the ability to temporarily block access to a service for four weeks, with the further possibility that that temporary ban could be repeated for a set number of times and thus prolonged for months, plural.<\/p>\n<p>So even if Musk&#8217;s fortune (and inclination) were to extend to regularly shelling out for very large fines (up to hundreds of millions of dollars on current Twitter revenue) he may have harder pause about taking a course of &#8216;free speech&#8217; action that, de facto, limits Twitter&#8217;s reach by leading to the service being blocked across the EU &#8212; since he claims he&#8217;s buying it to defend it as an important speech forum for human &#8220;civilization.&#8221; (Assuming he&#8217;s not narrowly defining that to mean in the U.S. of A.)<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"0oJSb67P7c\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/23\/digital-services-act-political-deal-dsa\/\">Europe seals a deal on tighter rules for digital services<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Europe seals a deal on tighter rules for digital services&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/23\/digital-services-act-political-deal-dsa\/embed\/#?secret=HZB3KDIeLL#?secret=0oJSb67P7c\" data-secret=\"0oJSb67P7c\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>While the full spectrum of the DSA isn&#8217;t due to come into force until the start of 2024, rules for VLOPs have a shorter implementation period &#8212; of six months &#8212; so the regime will likely be up and running for platforms like Twitter in early 2023.<\/p>\n<p>That means if Musk wants to &#8212; shall we say &#8212; &#8216;fuck around and find out&#8217; how far he can push the needle on speech absolutism across the EU, he won&#8217;t have very long before the Commission and other regulators are empowered to come calling if\/when he fails to meet their democratic standard. (In Germany, there are already laws in place for platforms: The country has been regulating hate speech takedowns on social media <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/10\/02\/germanys-social-media-hate-speech-law-is-now-in-effect\/\">since 2017<\/a> &#8212; hence the &#8216;joke&#8217; has long been that if you want a de-Nazified version of Twitter you just change your country to &#8220;Germany&#8221; in the settings and your Twitter feed will instantly become fascist-free.)<\/p>\n<p>The DSA puts a number of specific obligations on VLOPs that may not exactly be front of mind for Musk as he celebrates an expensive new addition to his company portfolio (albeit, still pending shareholder approval) &#8212; including requiring platforms to carry out risk assessments related to the dissemination of illegal content; to consider any negative impacts on fundamental European rights such as privacy and freedom of expression; and look at risks of intentional manipulation of the service (such as election interference) &#8212; and then to act upon these assessments by putting in place &#8220;reasonable, effective and proportionate&#8221; measures to combat the specific systemic risks identified; all of which must be detailed in &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; yearly reports, among a slew of other requirements.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;An &#8216;Elonised&#8217; version of Twitter would probably not meet the DSA requirements of articles 26-27,&#8221; predicts Mathias Vermeulen, public policy director at the digital rights agency AWO. &#8220;This can lead to fines (which Musk doesn\u2019t care about), but it could lead to Twitter being banned in the EU in case of repeated violations. That\u2019s when it really gets interesting: Would he change his ideal vision of Twitter to preserve the EU market? Or is he prepared to drop it because he didn\u2019t buy this as a business opportunity but to &#8216;protect free speech in the U.S.&#8217;?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The U.K., meanwhile &#8212; which now sits outside the bloc &#8212; has its own, bespoke &#8216;harms mitigating&#8217; social media-focused legislation on the horizon. The Online Safety Bill now before the country&#8217;s parliament bakes in even higher fines (up to 10% of global turnover) and adds another type of penalty into the mix: The <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/16\/online-safety-bill-parliament\/\">threat of jail time for named executives<\/a> deemed to be failing to comply with regulatory procedures.

It\u2019s going to be interesting to watch!&#8221; says Paul Bernal, a U.K.-based professor of IT law at the University of East Anglia. &#8220;The big risk (as ever) is that he fails to understand that his own experience of Twitter is very different from what happens to other people.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere, a growing number of countries are setting their own local restrictions and ramping up operational risks for owners of speech fencing platforms.<\/p>\n<p>This includes a growing number of autocratic (or autocratically leaning) regimes that are actively taking steps to censor the internet and restrict access to social media &#8212; countries such as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/07\/twitter-russia-access\/\">Russia<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2014\/03\/20\/twitter-goes-dark-in-turkey-hours-after-the-countrys-pm-threatened-to-wipe-out-the-service\/\">Turkey<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/06\/twitter-has-lost-liability-protection-in-india-government-says\/\">India<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/04\/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence\/\">Nigeria<\/a> &#8212; where platforms that are &#8216;non-compliant&#8217; with state mandates may also face fines, service shut downs, police raids and threats of jail time for local execs.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;A platform might be able to get away with free-speech absolutism if it restricted its operations to the United States with its specific and peculiar First Amendment tradition. But most platforms have 90% or more of their users outside the U.S., and a growing number of governments around the world, both democratic and less so, increasingly want to influence what people are and are not allowed to see online. This goes for the European Union. It clearly goes for China. It also goes for a number of other countries,&#8221; says Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, a professor of political communication and director at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Saying &#8216;I&#8217;m for free speech&#8217; is at best a starting point for how private companies can respond to this. If you are rich enough, you can maybe soak up the fines some governments will impose on companies that in the name of free speech (or for other reasons) refuse to do as they are asked to. But in a growing number of cases the next steps include for example going after individual company employees (Indian police have raided local Twitter offices), forcing ISPs to throttle access to a platform (as the Turkish government has done) or ultimately block it entirely (as the Nigerian government has done).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;So while in the United States, a platform that conducts content moderation on the basis of simplistic slogans will primarily face the fact that free speech is more complicated and ambiguous in practice than it is in theory, and that both users and other customers like advertisers clearly see that and expect companies to manage that complexity as clearly, consistently and transparently as possible; in the rest of the world every platform will &#8212; if it wants to do business &#8212; face the fact that governments increasingly want to influence who gets to say what, where and when.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And that they (at best through independent judiciary and independent regulators, at worst directly through the executive branch), not individual proprietors or private companies, will want to decide what should and should not be free speech.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Nothing Musk has said or done suggests he has anything other than a U.S.-centric understanding of &#8216;free speech.&#8217; And that he therefore has a limited understanding of the scope of speech restrictions that can, legally, apply to Twitter &#8212; depending on where in the world the service is being used. And (ofc!) the prospect of Musk owning Twitter can&#8217;t change any actual laws around speech &#8212; however much he makes striking statements equating his ownership to the defense of human civilization.<\/p>\n<p>Away from the (relatively clearly defined) line of illegal speech, perhaps most obviously (and depressingly), Musk having an overly simplistic understanding of &#8216;free speech&#8217; could doom Twitter users everywhere to a &#8216;Groundhog Day&#8217; style repeat of earlier stumbles &#8212; when the company&#8217;s (U.S.-centric) operators allowed the platform to steep in its worst users&#8217; bile, professing themselves &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/media\/2012\/mar\/22\/twitter-tony-wang-free-speech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the free speech wing of the free speech party<\/a>&#8221; while victimized users were essentially censored by the loudest bullies.<\/p>\n<p>It still feels like the very recent past (actually it was circa 2018!) when Twitter&#8217;s then CEO and co-founder, Jack Dorsey, appeared to have a micro epiphany about the need for Twitter to factor in &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/07\/30\/twitter-turns-to-academics-to-improve-conversational-health-on-the-platform\/\">conversational health<\/a>&#8221; if it wanted anyone other than Nazis to stick around on its platform. That in turn led to a slow plod of progress by the company to tackle toxicity and improve tools for users to protect themselves from abuse. (And, very latently, to a ban on &#8216;king&#8217; Twitter bully, Donald Trump.)<\/p>\n<p>A free speech absolutist like Musk &#8212; who is expert at using Twitter to bully his own targets &#8212; threatens to burn all that hard won work right back down to ground zero.<\/p>\n<p>But, of course, if he actually wants the world to want to hang out in his &#8220;town square&#8221; and talk that would be the polar opposite of a smart strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Musk may also try to turn his bullying on international regulators too, of course. He has (in)famously and publicly clashed with U.S. oversight bodies &#8212; repeatedly trolling the SEC, via Twitter (ofc) &#8212; including tweeting veiled insults that pun on its three letter acronym. Or recently referring to it (or at least some of its California staff) as &#8220;those bastards,&#8221; in reference to an investigation it had instigated when he tweeted about wanting to take Tesla private.<\/p>\n<p>Musk&#8217;s demonstrable rage and discomfort at the SEC&#8217;s perceived regulation of his own speech &#8212; and his open contempt for a public body whose job it is to police long-standing rules in areas like insider trading &#8212; doesn&#8217;t exactly bode well for him achieving friction-free relations with the long list of international oversight bodies poised to scrutinize his tenure at Twitter. And with whom he may soon be openly clashing on Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>If he&#8217;s not yet taking tweet pot shots at these &#8220;bastards&#8221; it&#8217;s likely because he doesn&#8217;t really know they exist yet &#8212; but that&#8217;s about to change. (After all, EU commissioners are already tweeting Musk to school him on how &#8220;quickly&#8221; he&#8217;ll &#8220;adapt&#8221; to their &#8220;rules,&#8221; as internal market commissioner Thierry Breton put it to &#8220;Mr Musk&#8221; earlier today \u2026 <em>Touch\u00e9<\/em>!)<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules \u2013 regardless of their shareholding.<\/p>\n<p>Mr Musk knows this well.<\/p>\n<p>He is familiar with European rules on automotive, and will quickly adapt to the Digital Services Act.<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/DSA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DSA<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Thierry Breton (@ThierryBreton) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ThierryBreton\/status\/1518904143066320896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 26, 2022<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>The Commission will be in charge of the oversight of VLOPs under the DSA once it&#8217;s in force &#8212; which means the EU&#8217;s executive body will be responsible for deciding whether larger platforms are in breach of the bloc&#8217;s governance structure for handling illegal speech, and, if so, for determining appropriate penalties or other measures to encourage them to reset their approach.<\/p>\n<p>Asked whether it has any concerns with Musk owning Twitter &#8212; given his free speech &#8220;absolutist&#8221; agenda &#8212; the Commission declined to comment on Twitter&#8217;s ownership change, or any individual (and still ongoing) business transaction, but a spokesperson told us: &#8220;The Commission will keep monitoring developments as they take place to ensure that once DSA enters into force, Twitter, like all other online platforms concerned will follow the rules.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>What does Musk want to do with Twitter?<\/h2>\n<p>Musk hasn&#8217;t put a whole lot of meat on the bones of <em>exactly<\/em> what he plans to do with Twitter &#8212; beyond broad brush strokes of taking the company private &#8212; and claiming his leadership will unlock its &#8220;tremendous potential.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>What he has said so far has focused in a few areas &#8212; freedom of expression being his seeming chief concern.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, the first two words of his emoji-laden victory tweet on having his bid to buy Twitter accepted are literally &#8220;free speech.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Though he also listed a few feature ideas, saying for example that he wants to open source Twitter&#8217;s algorithms &#8220;to increase trust.&#8221; He also made &#8220;defeating spam bots&#8221; part of his mission statement &#8212; which may explain another reference in the tweet to &#8220;authenticating all humans&#8221; (which has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/26\/elon-musk-twitter-privacy\/\">privacy advocates understandably concerned<\/a>).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcab\u2665\ufe0f Yesss!!! \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\ude80 <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/0T9HzUHuh6\">pic.twitter.com\/0T9HzUHuh6<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1518677066325053441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 25, 2022<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/14\/elon-musk-ted-talk-2022\/\">TED interview<\/a> earlier this month, before the sale deal had been sealed, Musk also responded to the question of why he wanted to buy Twitter by saying: &#8220;I think it&#8217;s very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He further dubbed the platform a &#8220;de facto town square.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law,&#8221; Musk went on. &#8220;One of the things I believe Twitter should do is open source the algorithm. And make any changes to people&#8217;s tweets &#8212; if they&#8217;re emphasized or deemphasized &#8212; that action should be made apparent so anyone can see that that action&#8217;s been taken. There&#8217;s no &#8216;behind the scenes&#8217; manipulation, either algorithmically or manually.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to the function of democracy, it&#8217;s important to the function of the United States as a free country &#8212; and many other countries &#8212; and actually to help freedom in the world more broadly than the U.S.,&#8221; he added. &#8220;And so I think the civilizational risk is decreased the more we can increase the trust of Twitter as a public platform and so I do think this will be somewhat painful.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>What Musk means by freedom of speech is more fuzzy, of course. He was directly pressed in the TED interview on what his self-claimed &#8220;absolutist&#8221; free speech position would mean for content moderation on Twitter &#8212; with the questioner asking a version of whether it might, for example, mean hateful tweets must flow?<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">By \u201cfree speech\u201d, I simply mean that which matches the law. <\/p>\n<p>I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law. <\/p>\n<p>If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1519036983137509376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 26, 2022<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Obviously Twitter or any forum is bound by the laws of any country it operates in so obviously there are some limitations on free speech in the U.S. and of course Twitter would have to abide by those rules,&#8221; Musk responded, sounding rather more measured than his ebullient, shitposting Twitter persona typically comes across as (which neatly illustrates the tonal dilemma of digital versus in-person speech; which is to say that something said in person, with all the associated vocal emotion, body language and physical human presence, may sound very different when texted and amplified to (potentially) a global audience of millions+ by algorithms that don&#8217;t understand human nuance and are great at trampling on context).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In my view, Twitter should match the laws of the country and really there&#8217;s an obligation to do that,&#8221; he also said, before circling back to what appears to be his particular beef vis-a-vis the topic of social media &#8216;censorship&#8217;: Invisible algorithmic amplification and\/or shadow-banning &#8212; aka, proprietary AIs that affect freedom of reach and are not open to external review.<\/p>\n<p>On this topic he may actually find fellow feeling with regulators and lawmakers in Europe &#8212; given that the just-agreed DSA requires VLOPs to provide users with &#8220;clear, accessible and easily comprehensible&#8221; information on the &#8220;main parameters&#8221; of content ranking systems (the regulation refers to these as &#8220;recommender systems&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p>The legislation also requires VLOPs to give users some controls over how these ranking and sifting AIs function &#8212; in order that users can change the outputs they see, and choose not to receive a content feed that&#8217;s based on profiling, for example.<\/p>\n<p>And Musk&#8217;s sketched vision of putting Twitter&#8217;s AIs &#8220;on GitHub&#8221; for nerds to tinker with is, kinda, a tech head&#8217;s version of that.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Having it be unclear who&#8217;s making what changes to where; having tweets mysteriously be promoted and demoted with no insight into what&#8217;s going on; having a blackbox algorithm promote some things and not other things. I think this can be quite dangerous,&#8221; he said in the TED interview, hinting that his time at Twitter might pay rather more attention to algorithmic content-disseminating apparatus &#8212; how the platform does or does not create &#8220;freedom of reach&#8221; &#8212; than excessively concerning himself with maximizing the extremis of expression that can be contained within a single tweet.<\/p>\n<p>So there are, on the surface, some striking &#8212; and perhaps surprising &#8212; similarities of thought in Musk&#8217;s stated concerns and EU lawmakers&#8217; focus in the DSA.<\/p>\n<p>He did also say he would probably want to set guidance that would prefer to keep speech up than take it down when expression falls in a gray area between legal and illegal speech &#8212; which is where the danger lies, potentially setting up a dynamic that could see Musk give a free pass to plenty of horribly abusive trolling, damaging conspiracy theories and outright disinformation. And that, in turn, could put him back on a collision course with European regulators.<\/p>\n<p>But he also sounded fairly thoughtful on this &#8212; suggesting dialing back algorithmic amplification could be an appropriate measure in gray area situations where there is &#8220;a lot of controversy.&#8221; Which seems quite far from absolutist.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we would want to err on the side of if in doubt, let the speech exist. If it&#8217;s a gray area I would say let the tweet exist but obviously in a case where there&#8217;s perhaps a lot of controversy you would not want to necessarily promote that tweet,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying that I have all the answers here but I do think that we want to be very reluctant to delete things and just be very cautious with permanent bans. Time outs I think are better that permanent bans.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be perfect but I think we just want to have the perception and reality that speech is a free as reasonably possible,&#8221; Musk also said, sketching a position that <em>may<\/em> amount to the equivalent of &#8216;freedom of speech is not the same as freedom of reach&#8217; (so sure the hateful tweet can stay up but that doesn&#8217;t mean the AI will give it any legs). &#8220;A good sign as to whether there&#8217;s free speech is, is someone you don&#8217;t like allowed to say something you don&#8217;t like. And if that is the case then we have free speech,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<p>On the content side, the EU&#8217;s incoming regulation mainly concerns itself with harmonizing procedures for tackling explicitly illegal speech &#8212; it avoids setting prescriptive obligations for fuzzier &#8216;perhaps harmful but not literally illegal&#8217; speech, such as disinformation, as regional lawmakers are very wary of being accused of speech policing.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, the bloc has decided to rely on other mechanisms for tackling harms like disinformation &#8212; such as a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/03\/europe-to-put-forward-rules-for-political-ads-transparency-and-beef-up-its-disinformation-code-next-year\/\">beefed up but still non-legally binding code of practice<\/a> &#8212; where platform signatories agree to &#8220;obligations and accountability&#8221; but won&#8217;t face set penalties, beyond the risk of public naming and shaming if they fail to live up to their claims.<\/p>\n<p>So if Musk does decide to let a tsunami of disinformation rip across Twitter in Europe the DSA may not, on paper, be able to do much about it.<\/p>\n<p>Geese agrees this is a &#8220;more complicated&#8221; area for EU regulation to tackle. But she notes that VLOPs would still have to do the risk assessments, be subject to independent scrutiny and audits, and provide researchers with access to platform data in order that they can study impacts of disinformation &#8212; which creates an investigative surface area where it becomes increasingly hard for platforms not to respond constructively to studied instances of societal harm.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My guess would be if Twitter goes bananas the interesting European people would leave,&#8221; she also suggests. &#8220;It would lose influence if its seen as a disinformation platform. But the risk is real.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Do you really think that his defence of free speech is including the dissemination of disinformation,&#8221; wonders Tang of Musk&#8217;s speech position vis-a-vis unfettered amplification of conspiracy theories, etc. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure on that. I think he&#8217;s been &#8212; what I have seen &#8212; pretty faint or not explicit about it, at least \u2026 On dissemination he&#8217;s not very clear.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Tang predicts that if Musk goes ahead with his idea of open sourcing Twitter&#8217;s algorithms it could be helpful by showing that Twitter &#8220;like other platforms, is basically built on trying to get disagreement because this is what people react to&#8221; &#8212; giving more evidence to the case for reforming how content gets algorithmically disseminated. &#8220;In that sense &#8212; that part of the plan &#8212; I think is good, or at least interesting,&#8221; he suggests.<\/p>\n<p>Another stated &#8220;top priority&#8221; for Musk &#8212; a pledge to kill off the Twitter spambots &#8212; looks positive in theory (no one likes spam and a defence of spam on speech grounds is tenuous) but the main question here is what exactly will be his method of execution? His reference to &#8220;authenticating all humans&#8221; looks worrying, as it would obviously be hugely damaging to Twitter as a platform for free expression if he means he will impose a real names policy and\/or require identity authentication simply to have an account.<\/p>\n<p>But, discussing this, Bernal wonders if Musk might not have a more tech-focused feature in mind for slaying spam that could also lead to a positive outcome. &#8220;Does he mean real names and verified information, or does he mean using AI to detect bot-like behaviour? If he means real names, he\u2019ll be massively damaging Twitter, without even realising what he\u2019s doing. If he means using AI to detect bots, it could actually be a good thing,&#8221; he suggests.<\/p>\n<p>The suspicion has long been that Twitter has never <em>really<\/em> wanted to kill off the spambots. Because identifying and purging all those fake accounts would decimate its user numbers and destroy shareholder value. But if Musk takes the company private and <em>literally doesn&#8217;t care<\/em> about Twitter&#8217;s economics he may actually be in a position to hit the spambot kill switch.<\/p>\n<p>If that&#8217;s his plan, Musk would, once again, be closer to the EU&#8217;s vision of platform regulation that he might imagine: The bloc has been trying to get platforms to agree to identify bots as part of a strategy to tackle disinformation since its first tentative Code of Practice <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/26\/tech-and-ad-giants-sign-up-to-europes-first-weak-bite-at-fake-news\/\">back in 2018<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/05\/twitter-is-considering-badging-bots-as-far-as-we-can-detect-them\/\">Dorsey talked around the topic<\/a>. How funny would it be if it takes Musk buying Twitter to <em>actually<\/em> get that done?<\/p>\n<p>Musk has also talked up <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/musk-proposes-twitter-blue-subscription-shake-up-days-after-disclosing-92-2022-04-10\/\">expanding Twitter&#8217;s subscription business<\/a> &#8212; which could put him in a position to purge spammy ads too&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>But what about an edit button? Every (sane) person thinks that&#8217;s a terrible idea. But Musk has repeatedly said it&#8217;s coming if he succeeds in owning Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>Asked about it at TED earlier this month &#8212; and specifically about the risk of an edit button creating a new vector for disinformation by letting people maliciously change the meaning of their tweets after the fact &#8212; Musk managed to sound surprisingly measured and thoughtful there too: &#8220;You&#8217;d only have the edit capability for a short period of time &#8212; and probably the thing to do upon reedit would be to zero out all retweets and favorites. I&#8217;m open to ideas though.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So, well, maybe Musk was trolling everyone about being &#8220;absolutist&#8221; all along.<\/p>\n<p>The wider question for regulators is whether the world&#8217;s richest man should be allowed to own a globally significant speech platform, one that punches far above its weight in user numbers in its ability to shape the news agenda. We asked the Commission if it&#8217;s ever proposed updating the bloc&#8217;s media ownership and concentration laws in lights of the growth of social media platforms &#8212; which now play a key role in mediating access to information and amplifying speech.

Bounce beat pandemic disruption and bagged a16z to lead its Series A"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/usebounce.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bounce<\/a>, a San Francisco-based startup that&#8217;s spent over three years building up a business which layers a number of convenience-focused services, starting with luggage storage and package acceptance, atop a network of independent retailers and other businesses located in cities around the world, is looking to bounce back in a big way from the impact of the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>The 2020 global freeze on leisure travel put a temporary pause on demand for short term luggage storage. More people working from home because of COVID-19 likely also temporarily reduced demand for third party package acceptance services &#8212; since more people were in to receive deliveries themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Bounce claims it was able to continue growing its business during the pandemic &#8212; saying i<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">t <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">paid out more than one million dollars to local businesses during the pandemic in spite of COVID-19&#8217;s impact. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s now anticipating a demand boom for its services as travellers jet off again and offices reopen to regular staff.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Currently, it&#8217;s <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">serving &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of customers per month &#8212; with its largest markets being <\/span>London, New York, and Paris &#8212;\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">but by late summer it expects to have grown monthly users to &#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s quite the change from two years ago.\u00a0Co-founder and CEO Cody Candee admits business &#8220;completely froze&#8221; for the first three months of the pandemic. But by summer 2020 there was a temporary unlocking as parts of Europe reopened to tourism &#8212; so Bounce focused its efforts on markets like Croatia at that point.<\/p>\n<p>He explains that it then kept retargeting different markets and regions as the impact of the virus fluctuated, seeking out pockets of opportunity as and where they appeared, such as switching focus from Europe to Australia in fall 2020 or targeting effort at non urban areas and domestic travel hotspots (&#8220;from Brighton to Myrtle Beach, to Hawaii&#8221;, is his concise summary).<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The upshot was Bounce was able to grow revenue 38x in 2021, per Candee &#8212; reaching &#8220;millions&#8221; in revenue, and expanding its partner network to 40 countries. Now almost half (45%) of its revenue comes from outside the U.S., he adds.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We basically just chased the opportunity wherever it was,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch, summing up how Bounce tackled the last two years of pandemic disruption. &#8220;All the while, we kept shipping pieces of content to our website while expanding our store network knowing it may not have much effect now but once the pandemic subsided, far more customers would discover us and we\u2019d have far more locations to serve these customers. It was a gamble and not easy but now we can say it paid off! We&#8217;re seeing explosive growth with the recovery of the pandemic all around the world.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To fuel the expected boom in growth, Bounce is announcing close of a $12 million Series A round of funding, led by Andreesen Horowitz. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other investors participating include General Catalyst, who led a seed round of funding, announced back in December 2021.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Commenting on the Series A in a statement,<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Andrew Chen, general partner at a16z, said:\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Bounce has shown tremendous resilience throughout the pandemic, continuing to not only build but also grow. By aggregating all different types of SMB supply &#8212; from hotels to post offices to bike rental shops &#8212; they&#8217;ve been able to establish a strong network that they can continue to grow and offer more services on top of.&#8221;\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The new funding will go on fast scaling in Europe &#8212; where key markets it&#8217;s targeting include Italy, France, and the UK. (Bounce also established a European HQ in Lisbon, Portugal, last year to prep for its regional growth push.)<\/p>\n<p>The Series A money will also be put towards expanding the number of services it offers. Although it&#8217;s not yet disclosing what additional services are coming down the pipe.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Bounce has a long list of other services we plan to introduce however we don&#8217;t yet have a public roadmap of new services,&#8221; says Candee when asked what else it wants to offer with the help of a growing network of small businesses partners who receive a revenue share for their part in providing services to Bounce users.<\/p>\n<p>The startup has more than 7,000 locations signed up to offer Bounce services at this stage. All locations offer luggage storage &#8212; but only a subset (around 2,000) do package acceptance.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of coverage spread, <a href=\"https:\/\/usebounce.com\/city\/london\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">London<\/a><\/span> currently leads as the city where Bounce has the most partners (200); followed by <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">170 in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/usebounce.com\/city\/paris\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paris<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and &#8220;dozens&#8221; more apiece in other European cities such as Madrid, Rome, Budapest and Dubrovnik.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The revenue split for these partners is &#8220;typically&#8221; 50-50, per Candee, who confirms that Bounce covers &#8220;all fees&#8221; for partners &#8212; e.g. payment processing, customer acquisition, marketing signage (such as the below example displayed outside a shop).<\/p>\n<p>Bounce users can pay-per-item (90% of its customers currently do that). But it also offers a subscription option for package acceptance customers and appears to have big plans on that front, with Candee noting that it will be investing more in subscription offerings later this year.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2305953\" style=\"width: 520px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2305953\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2305953\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bounce-outdoor-sign.jpeg?w=510\" alt=\"Bounce outdoor sign\" width=\"510\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bounce-outdoor-sign.jpeg 3024w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bounce-outdoor-sign.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bounce-outdoor-sign.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bounce-outdoor-sign.jpeg?resize=768,1024 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bounce-outdoor-sign.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bounce-outdoor-sign.jpeg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bounce-outdoor-sign.jpeg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Bounce-outdoor-sign.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2305953\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bounce signage for luggage storage outside a shop. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Bounce<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The second of Bounce&#8217;s two current service offerings &#8212; package acceptance &#8212; launched in March last year.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The package service was a top customer request, particularly in cities like New York,&#8221; says Candee. &#8220;This is especially useful to them compared to PO Boxes or Amazon lockers because it provides a single nearby location where the customer can get <em>all<\/em> their packages. Customers don&#8217;t want to go to one place for Amazon packages, one place for UPS, one place for FedEx. Customers like having a dedicated address they can give out and collect all their parcels from.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He says the goal is, in five years&#8217; time, people will &#8220;walk down the street and see the Bounce logo and know they can do these 10 different services there&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>And while Bounce isn&#8217;t the only startup trying to simplify luggage storage globally (see the likes of <a href=\"https:\/\/vertoe.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vertoe<\/a>), Candee has for years emphasized a wider &#8220;platform&#8221; vision. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/12\/21\/bounce-seed-funding\/\">Back in 2018<\/a> he told us about &#8220;broader use cases&#8221; which could plug into Bounce&#8217;s network of bricks-and-mortar locations &#8212; such as having courier services transporting items between different partner locations in order that a user could, for example, drop off clothes at a convenient location for them and have them moved to the dry cleaner and returned back to where they want to pick them back up once the clothes are clean.<\/p>\n<p>Candee also describes Bounce&#8217;s mission as being to build &#8220;the biggest retail chain in the world without owning any stores&#8221; &#8212; comparing it to Airbnb vs hotels.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When the pandemic hit and small businesses lost all of their revenue, we asked them how we could best support them and the resounding answer was finding new ways to drive revenue,&#8221; he says, adding: &#8220;Our goal is to win the hearts of small businesses around the world, helping them grow and diversify their businesses and bringing the power of scalable tech to them. SMB&#8217;s are typically underserved by the technology industry yet they fuel so much of the economy &#8212; we&#8217;re excited to be a key player in driving a new way of commerce to all different types of small businesses around the world.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Bounce talks in term of a &#8220;BounceBack Program&#8221; &#8212; aka, a &#8220;pledge&#8221; to support small business to &#8220;&#8216;bounce back&#8217; as we continue to climb out of the pandemic&#8221;, as its marketing puts it. And earlier this month it said it would be paying out $3M to its partners &#8220;over the next few months&#8221; via this program.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;With BounceBack, we are, in certain cases, offering guaranteed revenue to stores for this period. We\u2019re also investing far more in local marketing,&#8221; says Candee of this program.<\/p>\n<p>It also recently announced a BouncePlus Program for partners who &#8220;go the extra mile to provide the best Bounce experience possible&#8221; &#8212; saying that would further dial up benefits via extras such as weekly payouts, tipping, free signage, a dedicated account manager and a featured presence on the Bounce platform.<\/p>\n<div>Bounce says the requirements for getting BouncePlus perks are to: Maintain a high review score; have ~zero \u201cdrops\u201d (which means &#8220;store hours are up to date and customers always get served&#8221;); and that all bags stored must go through the Bounce platform (&#8220;providing the highest levels of bag safekeeping&#8221;).<\/div>\n<p>Depending on how much extra work is actually involved in meeting those requirements, being featured on Bounce&#8217;s platform offers the promise of &#8216;free&#8217; advertising for the SMEs &#8212; which may be offering highly relevant services of their own to Bounce&#8217;s convenience-minded and\/or tourist users, from bike rental or accommodation to selling ice cream and souvenirs, or indeed package sending services &#8212; giving independent businesses an incentive to drive Bounce&#8217;s quality of service in order to get the best chance of boosting footfall and winning extra business on top of whatever it directly pays them for their work.<\/p>\n<p>With the right mix of locations signed up, the incentives do therefore look very well aligned.<\/p>\n<p>Although the demands of convenience mean Bounce needs partners in certain locations of relevance to users, such as key transport hubs, regardless of whether the services they offer are likely to be of interest to its users &#8212; hence its partners can include businesses such as hairdressers and even offices as well as hotels and tourist-targeting retail outlets.<\/p>\n<p>The original idea for Bounce came to Candee back in 2014, although he didn&#8217;t start work on the startup until January 2018 &#8212; going on take take in $1.2M in early funding <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/12\/21\/bounce-seed-funding\/\">later that year<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>He says the idea came to him ahead of a Friday post-work Happy Hour event &#8212; when someone had said he would join but needed to go home first to drop off a bag to avoid carrying it around all night and Candee says it struck him that &#8220;people shouldn&#8217;t plan their days around their things&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s when I thought &#8212; wow, this is such a silly problem that so many people have, there should definitely be another way,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;The original idea was more of a vision: Cloud storage for the physical world &#8212; this idea that you could summon your things away from you and back to you, involving storage points around the city as well as delivery drivers moving your bags.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The platform itself <a href=\"https:\/\/www.producthunt.com\/posts\/bounce-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.producthunt.com\/posts\/bounce-7&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1650701283721000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2cCJ_QDN-S3x_KeS2ntYyp\">launched on Product Hunt<\/a> in February 2019, ahead of the pandemic. And by November 2021 Bounce was getting 10,000+ new customers storing luggage every month, per Candee.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The typical Bounce user for luggage storage is 24-35 years old though it&#8217;s pretty broad including anyone who is traveling or going to events,&#8221; he says now, adding: &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen a large uptick in usage around sporting events, concerts, etc as the pandemic subsides and everyone is eager to get out. Travel is also exploding right now.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"1xdpBd8nQp\"><p><a

It addresses a grab-bag of consumer protection and privacy concerns, as well as introducing algorithmic accountability requirements for large platforms to dial up societal accountability around their services. While &#8216;KYC&#8217; requirements are intended to do the same for online marketplaces.<\/p>\n<p>How effective the package will be is of course <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BeterOpDeFiets\/status\/1517798861338783744\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tbc<\/a> but the legislation that&#8217;s was agreed today goes further than the Commission proposal in a number of areas &#8212; with, for example, the European Parliament pushing to add in limits on tracking-based advertising.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">A prohibition on the use of so-called &#8216;dark patterns&#8217; for online platforms is also included &#8212; but not, it appears, a full blanket ban for all types of digital service (per details of the final text shared with TechCrunch via our sources).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">See below for a fuller breakdown of what we know so far about what&#8217;s been agreed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The DSA was presented as a draft proposal by the Commission back in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/15\/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants\/\">December 2020<\/a> which means it&#8217;s taken some 16 months of discussion &#8212; looping in the other branches of the EU: the directly elected European Parliament and the Council, which represents EU Member States&#8217; governments &#8212; to reach this morning&#8217;s accord.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>After last month&#8217;s deal on the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/25\/how-europe-has-expanded-its-bid-to-disrupt-big-tech\/\">Digital Markets Act<\/a> (DMA), which selectively targets the most powerful intermediating platforms (aka gatekeepers) with an ex ante, pro-competition regime, EU policy watchers may be forgiven for a little euphoria at the (relative) speed with which substantial updates to digital rules are being agreed.<\/p>\n<p>Big Tech&#8217;s lobbying of the EU over this period has been of an unprecedented scale in monetary terms. Notably, giants like Google have also sought to insert themselves into the &#8216;last mile&#8217; stage of discussions where EU institutions are supposed to shut themselves off from external pressures to reach a compromise, as a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/22\/google-facebook-apple-eu-lobbying-report\/\">report<\/a> published earlier today by Corporate Europe Observatory underlines. That illustrates what they believe is at stake.<\/p>\n<p>The full impact of Google <em>et al<\/em>&#8216;s lobbying won&#8217;t be clear for months or even years. But, at the least, Big Tech&#8217;s lobbyists were not success in entirely blocking the passage of the two major digital regulations &#8212; so the EU is saved from an embarrassing repeat of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/01\/digging-into-googles-push-to-freeze-eprivacy\/\">the (stalled) ePrivacy update<\/a> which may indicate that regional lawmakers are wising up to the tech industry&#8217;s tactics. Or, well, that Big Tech&#8217;s promises are not as shiny and popular as they used to be.<\/p>\n<p>The Commission&#8217;s mantra for the DSA has always been that the goal is to ensure that what&#8217;s illegal offline will be illegal online. And in a video message tweeted out in the small hours local time, a tired but happy looking EVP, Margrethe Vestager, said it&#8217;s &#8220;not a slogan anymore that&#8217;s what illegal offline should also be seen and dealt with online&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Now it is a real thing,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Democracy&#8217;s back.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It\u2019s a wrap!

The DSA will upgrade the ground-rules for all online services in the EU. It will ensure that the online environment remains a safe space, safeguarding freedom of expression and opportunities for digital businesses. It gives practical effect to the principle that what is illegal offline, should be illegal online. The greater the size, the greater the responsibilities of online platforms. Today\u2019s agreement &#8212; complementing the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/24\/dma-political-agreement\/\">political agreement on the Digital Markets Act last month<\/a> &#8212; sends a strong signal: to all Europeans, to all EU businesses, and to our international counterparts.\u201d<u><\/u><u><\/u><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In its own press release, the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.consilium.europa.eu\/en\/press\/press-releases\/2022\/04\/23\/digital-services-act-council-and-european-parliament-reach-deal-on-a-safer-online-space\/\">\u00a0Council<\/a>\u00a0called the DSA &#8220;a world first in the field of digital regulation&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>While the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.europarl.europa.eu\/news\/en\/press-room\/20220412IPR27111\/digital-services-act-agreement-for-a-transparent-and-safe-online-environment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">parliament<\/a> said the &#8220;landmark rules&#8230; effectively tackle the spread of illegal content online and protect people&#8217;s fundamental rights in the digital sphere&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ep-wysiwig_paragraph\">In a statement, its rapporteur for the file, MEP Christel Schaldemose, further suggested the DSA will &#8220;set new global standards&#8221;, adding: &#8220;Citizens will have better control over how their data are used by online platforms and big tech-companies. We have finally made sure that what is illegal offline is also illegal online. For the European Parliament, additional obligations on algorithmic transparency and disinformation are important achievements. These new rules also guarantee more choice for users and new obligations for platforms on targeted ads, including bans to target minors and restricting data harvesting for profiling.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Other EU lawmakers are fast dubbing the DSA a &#8220;European constitution for the Internet&#8221;. And it&#8217;s hard not to see the gap between the EU and the US on comprehensive digital lawmaking as increasingly gaping.<\/p>\n<p>Vestager&#8217;s victory message notably echoes encouragement <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/HillaryClinton\/status\/1517247388716613634\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tweeted out earlier this week<\/a> by the former US secretary of state, senator, first lady and presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, who urged Europe to get the DSA across the line and &#8220;bolster global democracy before it&#8217;s too late&#8221;, as she put it, adding: &#8220;For too long, tech platforms have amplified disinformation and extremism with no accountability. The EU is poised to do something about it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>DSA: What&#8217;s been agreed?<\/h2>\n<p>In their respective press releases trumpeting the deal, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.europarl.europa.eu\/news\/en\/press-room\/20220412IPR27111\/digital-services-act-agreement-for-a-transparent-and-safe-online-environment\">parliament<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.consilium.europa.eu\/en\/press\/press-releases\/2022\/04\/23\/digital-services-act-council-and-european-parliament-reach-deal-on-a-safer-online-space\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Council<\/a> have provided an overview of areas of key elements of the regulation they&#8217;ve agreed.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth emphasizing that the full and final text hasn&#8217;t been published yet &#8212; and won&#8217;t be for a while. It&#8217;s pending legal checks and translation into the bloc&#8217;s many languages &#8212; which means the full detail of the regulation and the implication of all its nuance remains tbc.<\/p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s an overview of what we know so far&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Scope, supervision &amp; penalties<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On scope, the Council says the DSA will apply to all online intermediaries providing services in the EU.<\/p>\n<p>The regulation&#8217;s obligations are intended to be proportionate to the nature of the services concerned and the number of users &#8212; with extra, &#8220;more stringent&#8221; requirements for &#8220;very large online platforms&#8221; (aka VLOPs) and very large online search engines (VLOSEs).<\/p>\n<p>Services with more than 45M monthly active users in the EU will be considered VLOPs or VLOSEs. So plenty of services will reach that bar &#8212; including, for example, the homegrown music streaming giant Spotify.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To safeguard the development of start-ups and smaller enterprises in the internal market,\u00a0micro and small enterprises with under 45 million monthly active users\u00a0in the EU will be\u00a0exempted\u00a0from certain\u00a0new\u00a0obligations,&#8221; the Council adds.<\/p>\n<p>The Commission itself will be responsible for supervising VLOPs and VLOSEs for the obligations that are specific to them &#8212; which is intended to avoid bottlenecks in oversight and enforcements of larger platforms (such as happened with the EU&#8217;s GDPR).<\/p>\n<p>But national agencies at the Member State level will supervise the wider scope of the DSA &#8212; so EU lawmakers say this arrangement maintains the country-of-origin principle that&#8217;s baked into existing digital rules.<\/p>\n<p>Penalties for breaches of the DSA can scale up to 6% of global annual turnover.<\/p>\n<p>Per the parliament, there will also be a right for recipients of digital services to seek redress for any damages or loss suffered due to infringements by platforms.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Content moderation &amp; marketplace rules<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The content moderation measures are focused on harmonizing rules to ensure &#8220;swift&#8221; removal of illegal content.<\/p>\n<p>This is being done through what the parliament describes as a &#8220;clearer &#8216;notice and action&#8217; procedure&#8221; &#8212; where &#8220;users will be empowered to report illegal content online and online platforms will have to act quickly&#8221;, as it puts it.<\/p>\n<p>It\u00a0also flags support for victims of cyber violence &#8212; who it says will be &#8220;better protected especially against non-consensual sharing (revenge porn) with immediate takedowns&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>MEPs say fundamental rights are protected from the risk of over-removal of content from the regulation putting pressure on platforms to act quickly through &#8220;stronger safeguards to ensure notices are processed in a non-arbitrary and non-discriminatory manner and with respect for fundamental rights, including the freedom of expression and data protection&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The regulation is also intended to ensure swift removal of illegal products\/services from online marketplaces. So there are new\u00a0 requirements incoming for ecommerce players.<\/p>\n<p>On this, the Council says the DSA will impose a &#8220;duty of care&#8221; on marketplaces vis-\u00e0-vis sellers who sell products or services on their online platforms.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Marketplaces will in particular have to collect and display information on the products and services sold in order to ensure that consumers are properly informed,&#8221; it notes, although there will be plenty of devil in the detail of the exact provisions.<\/p>\n<p>On this, the parliament says marketplaces will &#8220;have to ensure that consumers can purchase safe products or services online by strengthening checks to prove that the information provided by traders is reliable (&#8216;Know Your Business Customer&#8217; principle) and make efforts to prevent illegal content appearing on their platforms, including through random checks&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Random checks on traders\/goods had been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/13\/dsa-beuc\/\">pushed for by consumer protection organizations<\/a> &#8212; who had been concerned the measure would be dropped during trilogues &#8212; so EU lawmakers appear to have listened to those concerns.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Extra obligations for VLOPs\/VLOSEs<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>These larger platform entities will face scrutiny of how their algorithms work from the European Commission and Member State agencies &#8212; which the parliament says will both have access to the algorithms of VLOPs.<\/p>\n<p>The DSA also introduces an obligation for very large digital platforms and services to analyse &#8220;systemic risks they create&#8221; and to carry out &#8220;risk reduction analysis&#8221;, per the Council.<\/p>\n<p>The analysis must be done annually &#8212; which the Council suggests will allow for monitoring of and reduced risks in areas such as the dissemination of illegal content; adverse effects on fundamental rights; manipulation of services having an impact on democratic processes and public security; adverse effects on gender-based violence, and on minors and serious consequences for the physical or mental health of users.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, VLOPs\/VLOSEs will be subject to independent audits each year, per the parliament.<\/p>\n<p>Large platforms that use algorithms to determine what content users see (aka \u201crecommender systems\u201d) will have to provide at least one option that is not based on profiling. Albeit, many already do &#8212; although they often also undermine these choices by applying dark pattern techniques to nudge users away from control over their feeds so holistic supervision will be needed to meaningfully improve user agency.<\/p>\n<p>There will also be transparency requirements for the parameters of these recommender systems with the goal of improving information for users and any choices they make. Again, the detail will be interesting to see there.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Limits on targeted advertising\u00a0\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Restrictions on tracking-based advertising appear to have survived the trilogue process with all sides reaching agreement on a ban on processing minors&#8217; data for targeted ads.<\/p>\n<p>This applies to platforms accessible to minors &#8220;when they are aware that a user is a minor&#8221;, per the Council.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Platforms will be prohibited from presenting targeted advertising based on the use of minors\u2019 personal data as defined in EU law,&#8221; it adds.<\/p>\n<p>A final compromise text shared with TechCrunch by our sources suggests the DSA will stipulate that providers of online platforms should not do profile based advertising &#8220;when they are aware with reasonable certainty that the recipient of the service is a minor&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>A restriction on the use of sensitive data for targets ads has also made it into the text.<\/p>\n<p>The parliament sums this up by saying &#8220;targeted advertising is banned when it comes to sensitive data (e.g. based on sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity)&#8221;.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"65UxYki7nc\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/21\/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads\/\">Inside a European push to outlaw creepy ads<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Inside a European push to outlaw creepy ads&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/21\/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads\/embed\/#?secret=SP0GDeuEpu#?secret=65UxYki7nc\" data-secret=\"65UxYki7nc\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The wording of the final compromise text which we&#8217;ve seen states that: &#8220;Providers of online platforms shall not present advertising to recipients of the service based on profiling within the meaning of Article 4(4) of Regulation 2016\/679 [aka, the GDPR] using special categories of personal data as referred to in article 9(1) of Regulation 2016\/679.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Article 4(4) of the GDPR defines \u2018profiling\u2019 as: &#8220;any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person&#8217;s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements;&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>While the GDPR defines special category data as personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, as well as biometric and health data, data on sex life and\/or sexual orientation.<\/p>\n<p>So targeting ads based on tracking or inferring users&#8217; sensitive interests is &#8212; on paper &#8212; facing a hard ban in the DSA.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ban on use of dark patterns<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A prohibition on dark patterns also made it into the text. But, as we understand it, this only applies to &#8220;online platforms&#8221; &#8212; so it does not look like a blanket ban across all types of apps and digital services.<\/p>\n<p>That is unfortunate. Unethical practices shouldn&#8217;t be acceptable no matter the size of the business.<\/p>\n<p>On dark patterns, the parliament says: &#8220;Online platforms and marketplaces should not nudge people into using their services, for example by giving more prominence to a particular choice or urging the recipient to change their choice via interfering pop-ups. Moreover, cancelling a subscription for a service should become as easy as subscribing to it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The wording of the final compromise text that we&#8217;ve seen says that: &#8220;Providers of online platforms shall not design, organize or operate their online interfaces in a way that deceives, manipulates or otherwise materially distorts or impairs the ability of recipients of their service to make free and informed decisions&#8221; &#8212; after which there&#8217;s an exemption for practices already covered by Directive 2005\/29\/EC [aka the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive] and by the GDPR.<\/p>\n<p>The final compromise text we reviewed further notes that the Commission may issue guidance on specific practices &#8212; such as platforms giving more prominence to certain choices, repeatedly requesting a user makes a choice after they already have and making it harder to terminate a service than sign up. So the effectiveness of the dark pattern ban could well come down to how much attention the Commission is willing to give to a massively widespread online problem.<\/p>\n<p>The wording of the associated recital in the final compromise we saw also specifies that the dark pattern ban (only) applies for &#8220;intermediary services&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Crisis mechanism\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>An entirely new article was also added to the DSA following Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine &#8212; and in connection with rising concern around the impact of online disinformation &#8212; that creates a crisis response mechanism which will give the Commission extra powers to scrutinize VLOPs\/VLOSEs in order to analyze the impact of their activities to the crisis in question.<\/p>\n<p>The EU&#8217;s executive will also be able to come up with what the Council bills as &#8220;proportionate and effective measures to be put in place for the respect of fundamental rights&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The mechanism will be activated by the Commission on the recommendation of the board of national Digital Services Coordinators.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qm6F3S9tOs\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/02\/eu-rt-sputnik-ban-live\/\">EU&#8217;s ban on Russia Today and Sputnik is now in effect<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;EU&#8217;s ban on Russia Today and Sputnik is now in effect&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/02\/eu-rt-sputnik-ban-live\/embed\/#?secret=gynWEEvxlW#?secret=qm6F3S9tOs\" data-secret=\"qm6F3S9tOs\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"VprTBQtNML\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/25\/how-europe-has-expanded-its-bid-to-disrupt-big-tech\/\">How Europe has expanded its bid to disrupt Big Tech<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How Europe has expanded its bid to disrupt Big Tech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/25\/how-europe-has-expanded-its-bid-to-disrupt-big-tech\/embed\/#?secret=ataLBo8Vyv#?secret=VprTBQtNML\" data-secret=\"VprTBQtNML\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"6BBWI9bCj3\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/22\/google-facebook-apple-eu-lobbying-report\/\">Report reveals Big Tech&#8217;s last minute lobbying to weaken EU rules<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Report reveals Big Tech&#8217;s last minute lobbying to weaken EU rules&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/22\/google-facebook-apple-eu-lobbying-report\/embed\/#?secret=9PBu3O4RHI#?secret=6BBWI9bCj3\" data-secret=\"6BBWI9bCj3\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the small hours local time, European Union lawmakers secured a provisional deal on a landmark update to rules for digital services operating in the region &#8212; grabbing political agreement after a final late night\/early morning of compromise talks on the detail of what is a major retooling of the bloc&#8217;s existing ecommerce rulebook.

reveals Big Tech&#8217;s last minute lobbying to weaken EU rules"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A new report has peeled back the curtain on big tech&#8217;s frenzied lobbying of European Union lawmakers as they finalize a major series of updates to the bloc&#8217;s digital rulebook.<\/p>\n<p>It reveals some of the arguments used by tech giants including Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta (Facebook) and Spotify to press their interests behind the scenes in a bid to reshape key components of the EU&#8217;s Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Digital Services Act (DSA) &#8212; targeting areas such as surveillance advertising and access to platform data for researchers &#8212; with the clear intent of shielding their processes and business models from measures that could weaken their market power.<\/p>\n<p>The report, which is based on lobbying documents obtained by civil society groups <a href=\"https:\/\/corporateeurope.org\/en\">Corporate Europe Observatory<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.globalwitness.org\/en\/\">Global Witness<\/a> via freedom of information requests, also highlights how tech giants have ramped up their spending on regional lobbying since the DMA and DSA were proposed back in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/15\/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants\/\">December 2020<\/a> &#8212; with the big five collectively spending over \u20ac27M (close to $30M) last year alone.<\/p>\n<p>It concludes with a series of recommendations for how policymakers can better protect the democratic process from undue influence by the best resourced corporate giants.<\/p>\n<h2>Spend, spend, spend!<\/h2>\n<p>Citing publicly disclosed data, the report shows that Apple has increased its spending on EU lobbying the most &#8212; almost doubling how much it&#8217;s shelling out from \u20ac3.5M in 2020 to \u20ac6.5M in 2021, meaning it also pulled into the lead among platform peers for total regional lobbying spend last year.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook (Meta) had the next biggest increase, growing the size of its EU lobbying budget from \u20ac5.5M in 2020 to \u20ac6M in 2021. Google also topped up its outlay from \u20ac5.8M in 2020 to \u20ac6M. While Amazon and Microsoft both made similar increases in regional spending over this period.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2305112\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2305112\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2305112\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2022-04-22-at-13.35.26.png?w=680\" alt=\"Corporate Europe Observatory big tech lobbying spend EU\" width=\"680\" height=\"493\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2022-04-22-at-13.35.26.png 1224w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2022-04-22-at-13.35.26.png?resize=150,109 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2022-04-22-at-13.35.26.png?resize=300,218 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2022-04-22-at-13.35.26.png?resize=768,557 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2022-04-22-at-13.35.26.png?resize=680,493 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2022-04-22-at-13.35.26.png?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2305112\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image credit: Corporate Europe Observatory<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The DMA, which gained political agreement <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/24\/dma-political-agreement\/\">last month<\/a>, will apply only to the largest and most powerful intermediary platforms &#8212; so called &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221;; a designation that&#8217;s likely to apply to the five &#8216;big spenders&#8217; in the above chart &#8212; introducing a set of operational obligations these giants must abide by up-front.<\/p>\n<p>The pan-EU regulation, which is expected to come into force in October, aims to reboot competition in digital markets dominated by gatekeepers and ensure they remain open and fair.<\/p>\n<p>Its sister regulation &#8212; the DSA &#8212; applies more broadly, setting rules for all sorts of digital services which are intended to harmonize online approaches to tackling illegal content and products. This means it touches on areas like content moderation, consumer protection and transparency. And while it applies across digital services a subset of so-called &#8220;very large online platforms&#8221; (aka VLOPs) will be subject to additional oversight under the regulation &#8212; meaning that tech giants will face additional DSA compliance hurdles vs smaller players.<\/p>\n<p>At the time of writing the DSA is still pending political agreement &#8212; although a deal is expected after Friday&#8217;s (April 22) trilogue meeting &#8212; so the impact of big tech&#8217;s lobbying on EU policymaking should become clearer in the coming days.<\/p>\n<p>So what have tech giants been spending their millions on lobbying for as EU lawmakers finalize the DSA and DMA?<\/p>\n<p>Read on for a breakdown of their focus areas from the report&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>Surveillance advertising<\/h2>\n<p>One major target for Big Tech lobbyists, per the report, has been around surveillance advertising as tech giants marshalled their millions to block off an attempt to get an outright ban on tracking-based advertising into EU legislation.<\/p>\n<p>They succeeded in that goal as an <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/21\/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads\/\">earlier push by some MEPs for an outright ban<\/a> did not gain full backing of the parliament so did not make it into the trilogue discussions. But the European Parliament did vote to incorporate limits on tracking ads into both the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/20\/meps-vote-to-limit-tracking\/\">DSA<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/23\/ep-imco-dma-vote\/\">DMA<\/a> &#8212; with MEPs backing a ban on processing of minors&#8217; data for targeting ads and a ban on use of sensitive categories of personal data.<\/p>\n<p>However the Council position diverged from parliament, toeing closer to the Commission&#8217;s original proposal &#8212; which had merely suggested ads transparency requirements &#8212; so tech giants sought to exploit this to try to water down restrictions on tracking ads, per the report.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"zJ7IjXBVIN\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/21\/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads\/\">Inside a European push to outlaw creepy ads<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Inside a European push to outlaw creepy ads&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/21\/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads\/embed\/#?secret=4xV1ImTghu#?secret=zJ7IjXBVIN\" data-secret=\"zJ7IjXBVIN\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Documents obtained for the report show that Google directly lobbied the Commission in a series of high level meetings with top commissioners between <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">November and early January in which the adtech giant raised concerns about the European Parliament\u2019s proposals on advertising &#8212; suggesting limits on trackings would be detrimental to SMEs and harm news publishers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This marked a continuation of Google and Facebook\u2019s strategy throughout the whole discussion on new digital regulations &#8212; trying to reframe it away from Big Tech\u2019s immense profits and business model and to instead hype up potential negative impacts for smaller businesses and consumers,&#8221; the report notes. &#8220;As Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/corporateeurope.org\/en\/2020\/12\/big-tech-brings-out-big-guns-fight-future-eu-tech-regulation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leaked lobbying strategy<\/a> showed, one of its priorities was to focus the discussion on the costs to the economy and consumers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Between January to the end of March, lobby documents show that<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> Google remained in frequent contact with the Swedish government &#8212; arguing on<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> four different occasions against Parliament\u2019s proposal to ban advertising targeted at minors and other limits, per the report.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> &#8220;Their recommendation to national governments was to &#8216;support the Council \/ Commission position (i.e. no restraints on targeted ads&#8217;). Google argued &#8216;that the DSA is not the right forum to deal with these issues&#8217;,&#8221; it adds.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a special irony here given <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/01\/digging-into-googles-push-to-freeze-eprivacy\/\">Google also led big tech lobbying efforts to delay an update to the bloc&#8217;s ePrivacy rules<\/a> &#8212; which explicitly cover tracking technologies like cookies. That update remains stalled even now (the Commission proposal was presented all the way back in January 2017!). So if the tech giant were to have its way there would, it seems, be no &#8216;appropriate&#8217; legal forum to rein in its surveillance ads empire. Funny that! \ud83d\ude44<\/p>\n<p>But as it turns out, EU lawmakers in the Council and Parliament were able to agree &#8212; through the trilogue process &#8212; on including limits to tracking ads.<\/p>\n<p>At least that was the position announced last month, at the moment of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/24\/dma-political-agreement\/\">political agreement on the DMA<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>At the time of writing the Commission is signalling that limits on targeting advertising will be included in the DSA, with internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, including a ban on targeted advertising to children or based on sensitive data in a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ThierryBreton\/status\/1517420520194641920\">tweet storm<\/a> highlighting &#8220;10 things you need to know&#8221; about the regulation, for example&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">6\u20e3 Ban on targeted advertising for children \ud83d\udeab<br \/>\u00a0<br \/>More <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/protection?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#protection<\/a> against targeted advertising aimed at children \u2014 or based on sensitive data.<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/DSA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DSA<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Thierry Breton (@ThierryBreton) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ThierryBreton\/status\/1517423339530342400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 22, 2022<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>Under the political deal reached between EU co-legislators last month, the DMA requires gatekeepers to gain explicit consent from users to combine their personal data for advertising.<\/p>\n<p>But t<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">he French presidency of the Council also said then that they had agreed complementary provisions to limit tracking ads would <\/span><em style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">also<\/em><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> be included in the text of the DSA (still to be agreed via trilogue) &#8212; signalling that the parliament&#8217;s goal of limits on processing children&#8217;s data for ads or using sensitive data for ads would make it into EU law.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So what did Google&#8217;s lobbyists do next? According to the report, the tech giant continued pushing against any\/all limits on surveillance ads &#8212; but also evolved the lobbying tactic, by suggesting to Member States governments ways in which restrictions could be watered down in the final text to limit their impact on its ability to track and target web users.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;On 22 March 2022, the day of the final DMA trilogue, Google sent the Swedish government its thoughts for future trilogue meetings,&#8221; notes the report. &#8220;Google\u2019s positions reflected the up to date state of the ongoing discussions. Google continued to oppose concrete new proposals regarding user consent to tracking and banning the use of sensitive data for advertising. Perhaps more interesting though, Google now seemed to understand that likely there would be some new limits to targeted advertising. So Google offered suggestions about how these should be drafted: the ban on targeting minors should be limited to &#8216;known minors&#8217; and behaviour advertising should be defined as the use of individual profiling.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As the report points out, Google&#8217;s fall back positions here are no accident &#8212; given that the tech giant has been working for several years to retool its tracking apparatus &#8212; under its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/31\/privacy-sandbox-global-trials\/\">so-called Privacy Sandbox plan<\/a> &#8212; which proposes to switch from individual-level tracking and targeting to cohort or (now) <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/25\/google-kills-off-floc-replaces-it-with-topics\/\">topic-based targeting<\/a> which will continue to subject web users to behavioral targeting just now putting them into buckets of eyeballs, not solo pairs.<\/p>\n<p>So &#8212; to spell it out &#8212; if EU lawmakers were to limit the definition of behavioral advertising as Google suggests it could simply circumvent any limits on its flavor of behavioral advertising by saying it does not target individuals ergo the legal restriction simply doesn&#8217;t apply.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"fJr82TKDVF\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/01\/digging-into-googles-push-to-freeze-eprivacy\/\">Digging into Google&#8217;s push to freeze ePrivacy<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Digging into Google&#8217;s push to freeze ePrivacy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/01\/digging-into-googles-push-to-freeze-eprivacy\/embed\/#?secret=7qHeT0uMZe#?secret=fJr82TKDVF\" data-secret=\"fJr82TKDVF\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Similarly, a final text that would ban advertising to &#8220;known minors&#8221; would allow Google to claim it does not <em>know<\/em> the age of users who are not logged into its services (and potentially even users who are logged in as it does not explicitly age verify users) &#8212; again avoiding the need to restrict its behavioral targeting by default across most services (barring any it directly targets at children, such as YouTube kids).<\/p>\n<p>Per the report, Google&#8217;s lobbyists didn&#8217;t stop there. They also sought to water down ad transparency requirements &#8212; pushing back against proposals that would allow users to know the criteria used to target them specifically, including when ads were targeted at kids and &#8212; in &#8220;detailed suggestions&#8221; to national governments &#8212; proposed that they should &#8220;seek to delete the obligation to disclose the criteria used for targeting, even when ads target vulnerable people like children&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The documents show Google taking a central position lobbying against limits to surveillance ads,&#8221; the report adds. &#8220;But they weren\u2019t alone. Facebook, and other European companies [including Spotify] and publishers also resorted to trying to persuade national governments to oppose the Parliament\u2019s position.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Another big target for Big Tech tech lobbying was around data access for NGOs and public scrutiny&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>Public scrutiny<\/h2>\n<p>On this issue, which is core to the DSA&#8217;s ability to deliver on the goal of ramping up accountability around major platforms, the report details particular moves by Spotify and Google to limit how much access external researchers can gain to platform data &#8212; such as to carry out research into the societal impact of recommender algorithms.<\/p>\n<p>Civil society groups have been pushing to strengthen the Commission proposal in this area &#8212; to increase external scrutiny of VLOPs by forcing them to give access to data on algorithmic content ranking systems to vetted external researchers so they can study their function.<\/p>\n<p>But Spotify and Google have been busy pushing back against closer scrutiny of how their AIs rank and recommend content to users, per the report.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The world\u2019s biggest music streaming service didn\u2019t want the transparency requirements to include detailed lists of parameters, as was introduced by the Parliament.

This tactic boils down to one word: Delay.<\/p>\n<p>Per the report:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;[T]<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">he top level message from the Big Tech companies to policy-makers regarding the DMA was the same across the board: Big Tech wanted to build a dialogue between the DMA\u2019s regulator &#8212; the European Commission &#8212; and the companies covered by it &#8212; the gatekeepers, into the text and the regulatory approach. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;They brought this wish up consistently at the high level meetings, such as the December meeting between Google and [Margrethe] Vestager\u2019s cabinet. There Google said that regarding the DMA their &#8216;core argument towards the Parliament was the need for regulatory dialogue and the opportunity to individually justify certain practices&#8217;. Google repeated the same message to Breton\u2019s cabinet in January &#8212; &#8216;Proper regulatory dialogue is important to ensure the enforcement of the DMA&#8217;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;On the very same day, Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s head lobbyist, told Commissioner [Didier] Reynders, that for Facebook &#8216;it would be helpful to have the possibility of having a dialogue with regulators on questions concerning compliance&#8217;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;Amazon, in turn, told the Swedish government that it was &#8216;more comfortable with content of the Council compromise proposal than with the European Parliament&#8217;s amendments.&#8217; The company also raised concerns that specific measures had been moved from Article 6 to Article 5, which would mean they would be automatically applicable and not dependent on a regulatory dialogue.&#8221;<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Thing is, the whole point of the DMA is to bring in an ex ante competition regime for the bloc &#8212; via a set of &#8216;dos and don&#8217;ts&#8217; that are supposed to apply up front for companies designated as gatekeepers, i.e. rather than antitrust authorities having to do the slow and painstaking work of building a case against a particular abusive behavior <em>while the market suffers<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>But there is &#8212; potentially &#8212; a sliver of wiggle room, at least for obligations set out in Article 6 of the DMA. For those requirements, the regulation allows for a dialogue between the Commission and relevant companies over how best to comply.<\/p>\n<p>Which, well, sounds like it could be spun into delay heaven.<\/p>\n<p>The report summarizes the main aim of Big Tech\u2019s lobby campaign against the DMA as being to &#8220;expand this dialogue as much as possible&#8221;, with Corporate Europe Observatory noting it fingered this as a key priority for Facebook, Google and Apple since last summer. It also quotes another lobby transparency group, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lobbycontrol.de\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lobbycontrol<\/a>, which has argued that Big Tech\u2019s aim here is to &#8220;gain time &#8212; and first of all an entrance point for challenging the DMA\u2019s obligations.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"4IMs7115so\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/22\/facebooks-lead-eu-privacy-supervisor-hit-with-corruption-complaint\/\">Facebook&#8217;s lead EU privacy supervisor hit with corruption complaint<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook&#8217;s lead EU privacy supervisor hit with corruption complaint&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/22\/facebooks-lead-eu-privacy-supervisor-hit-with-corruption-complaint\/embed\/#?secret=QLxGIcuENx#?secret=4IMs7115so\" data-secret=\"4IMs7115so\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The painstakingly slow &#8216;<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/13\/irelands-draft-gdpr-decision-against-facebook-branded-a-joke\/\">regulatory dialogue<\/a>&#8216; which Facebook and other tech giants have managed to establish with their lead EU privacy regulator &#8212; Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission &#8212; since (and, indeed, even before) the GDPR came into force in 2018, enabling them to successful delay enforcement despite multiple open investigations into a variety of aspects of their businesses, is likely providing Clegg &amp; co with plentiful inspiration for the sort of friction-filled conversation they want signed off and baked into the DMA to create a legally viable &#8216;back and forth&#8217; that lets them delay actually changing abusive practices for as long as humanly possible.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear how successful the tech giants have been in this regard.<\/p>\n<p>However the Commission has, in recent weeks, been spotted making some concerning noises on the topic of DMA enforcement to anyone who actually wants to see regulators crack down on Big Tech, as consumer protection experts have observed&#8230;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I cannot believe that the Commission talks so lightly about <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/DMA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DMA<\/a> enforcement\u2026 it\u2019s the Commission\u2019s kitchen; it will take time to implement; we don\u2019t have resources etc. Seriously people?

The EU Institutions have argued that this secrecy is needed in part to prevent lobbying pressure on the policy-makers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;New lobby documents obtained from the European Commission and the Swedish government via freedom of information requests show that intense corporate lobbying is happening regardless of the lack of transparency.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The details that the civil society groups were able to glean on big tech&#8217;s lobbying around the DMA and DSA are only partial, as the report notes that responses to freedom of information requests varied.<\/p>\n<p>However they say the documents they did obtain showed that tech giants like Google continued to target the trilogue process even after the Council had agreed its negotiating positions &#8212; meaning they are shown trying to grasp a very last minute, non-transparent opportunity to favorably water down measures that could shrink their market power.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We can now confirm that corporate lobbying of EU capitals continues even after the Council agrees its positions and starts trilogue negotiations with the Parliament and Commission,&#8221; the report authors write. &#8220;While only Sweden gave us extensive access to these documents, we can expect that all EU governments must be on the receiving end of similar lobby efforts.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The lobby documents also reveal that Google remained in frequent contact with the Swedish government from January to the end of March (the time when we placed our freedom of information request). During this period, the tech giant would send in analysis of the difference positions, adding the company\u2019s own analysis, and all the while replicating the EU Institutional format of documents with four columns,&#8221; they go on. &#8220;As the discussions went on behind closed doors, Google pitched in with &#8216;specific language on articles currently discussed&#8217; and suggested &#8216;concrete amendments&#8217;, showing a strikingly live knowledge of what was happening in the negotiation process.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>According to the report, <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook &#8212; alongside European firms such as Spotify and the copyright industry &#8212; actively sought to influence the trilogues themselves, meaning they were trying to exert influence during the least transparent point of the co-legislative process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The lobbying tactics they are reported to have used included:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>pitting the EU Institutions against one another;<\/li>\n<li>becoming more technical and offering amendments to the text;<\/li>\n<li>using meetings to gain access to information that was not available to the public;<\/li>\n<li>going high level: bringing in the CEOs to meet Commissioners, inviting them to off the record dinners.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Corporate Europe Observatory and Global Witness argue that this evidence of lobbying taking place during trilogues &#8220;shows how the lack of transparency benefits big corporate lobbies and adds weight to the urgency of finally opening the trilogues process up to the public&#8221; &#8212; further suggesting: &#8220;This secrecy means that only the well-resourced and well-connected lobbying actors can follow and intervene in trilogues, and excludes citizens from crucial discussions that will have an impact on their lives.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;National governments have a say in EU policy-making via the Council. This is often referred to as the EU\u2019s \u2018black box\u2019, as it is difficult for citizens to know who is lobbying their national government on EU policies, or even what position their national government takes in the Council. This approach, combined with the fact that lobbying at member state level requires massive resources and good connections, creates the conditions for undue corporate influence,&#8221; they add.<\/p>\n<p>The report makes a series of recommendations to protect EU policymaking against undue influence by the most well-resourced lobbyists, based on the NGOs&#8217; tracking and analysis of the DSA and DMA process since the drafting stages.<\/p>\n<p>Its suggestions include shedding light into the trilogues by publishing an up-to-date calendar of meetings, including summary agendas, and proactively publishing the four-column document (which details co-legislator positions and amendments) on a rolling basis; boosting transparency and democratic accountability at the Member State and Council level including by requiring disclosure of each country\u2019s position; putting limits on one-to-one lobby meetings and replacing them with public hearings as much as possible; and requiring EU institutions to proactively seek out those who have less resources, such as SMEs, independent academics, civil society and community groups.<\/p>\n<p>Other recommendations include beefing up the existing <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/about-european-commission\/service-standards-and-principles\/transparency\/transparency-register_en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EU Transparency Register<\/a> to improve transparency on lobbying; putting in place proper funding transparency requirements that mandate think tanks and other organisations to reveal their funding sources; strengthening ethics rules to block the revolving door between EU institutions and Big Tech firms and establishing an independent ethics committee which can launch investigations and implement sanctions.<\/p>\n<p>The report authors also urge EU officials and policymakers to be sceptical of those lobbying them &#8212; writing that they &#8220;should question their funding sources, check their information and data sources and denounce any type of wrongdoing or non-transparent\/unethical lobbying they encounter&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>They also recommend they should not attend or participate in events or debates that are closed to the public, held under Chatham House rules, or that do not disclose their sponsorship.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"nmJYZddRbS\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/25\/how-europe-has-expanded-its-bid-to-disrupt-big-tech\/\">How Europe has expanded its bid to disrupt Big Tech<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How Europe has expanded its bid to disrupt Big Tech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/25\/how-europe-has-expanded-its-bid-to-disrupt-big-tech\/embed\/#?secret=b9k2ba5nHT#?secret=nmJYZddRbS\" data-secret=\"nmJYZddRbS\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"hDQQ9Iugmp\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/30\/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook\/\">Understanding Europe&#8217;s big push to rewrite the digital rulebook<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Understanding Europe&#8217;s big push to rewrite the digital rulebook&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/30\/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook\/embed\/#?secret=3eYwct0j1X#?secret=hDQQ9Iugmp\" data-secret=\"hDQQ9Iugmp\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A new report has peeled back the curtain on big tech&#8217;s frenzied lobbying of European Union lawmakers as they finalize a major series of updates to the bloc&#8217;s digital rulebook.

is helping grocery retailers fight food waste"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">For years grocery retailers have been using data driven forecasting to help them predict demand to figure out which products to reorder to keep shelves stocked. That&#8217;s nothing new. But Berlin-based startup <a href=\"https:\/\/freshflow.ai\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Freshflow<\/a> is targeting a particular slice of this market: It&#8217;s built an AI-powered forecasting platform to help retailers optimize stock replenishment of fresh, perishable goods &#8212; such as fruit and vegetables, meat, dairy and bakery products &#8212; in order that food waste is minimized and retailer revenue maximized.<\/p>\n<p>It says its first customer has seen a 28% reduction in food waste and a 16% increase in revenue after around eight months using its AI-powered system to automate fresh produce restocking &#8212; with average rates across the (handful of) early adopters standing at 30% less food waste and a 16.7% revenue boost.<\/p>\n<p>A quirk of grocery retailing is that fresh produce reordering is often still done manually, says Freshflow co-founder Avik Mukhija, with supermarket staff taking what often amount to &#8220;gut instinct&#8221; decisions on how much fresh produce to reorder &#8212; which can lead to over-ordering that not only hits revenue but leads to food waste as unsold items spoil quickly and have to be thrown away; and also under-ordering &#8212; meaning retailers are losing out on extra revenue if shoppers are frustrated by empty shelves.<\/p>\n<p>The reasons manual reordering has persisted for this (fresh) segment of grocery retail are myriad, according to Mukhija &#8212; including short (but non-uniform) shelf lives; quality variation; seasonality; and products often being sold by weight rather than piece, which complicates ERP inventory data. &#8220;Those challenges combined make fresh products inherently different to packaged,&#8221; he argues, saying it&#8217;s been almost a &#8220;retail mantra that a human being could still manually do this better than a system could.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And because that is the opinion \u2026 until now, for the most part, retailers have just relied upon people to do this part.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Freshflow&#8217;s premise is that machine learning can do a far better, less wasteful job at restocking fresh food than the human eye, nose and gut by being able to weight a variety of factors that may affect demand (such as weather, season, local events) and by crunching available retailer data to do probabilistic modelling and predictions (such as to forecast the shelf life of different produce) to &#8212; overall &#8212; more accurately match supply and demand.<\/p>\n<p>Mukhija says its early results (albeit for a small number of customers) stand that up. &#8220;Our prediction is definitely better than what has been done historically using gut feeling because we have reduced the waste and seen a significant revenue increase.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;When you look at the graphs between what we predict in terms of sales and what actually happens it almost tracks it perfectly,&#8221; adds co-founder Carmine Paolino &#8212; who, when asked about the model&#8217;s accuracy, tells us the &#8220;mean absolute error&#8221; for its predictions so far is &lt;1.<\/p>\n<p>Assuming Freshflow&#8217;s AI can maintain this early performance as it scales to serve more retailers, the startup looks to be onto something big and important: A<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">s it notes, the grocery retail sector is responsible for some 5% of the total amount of food thrown away annually, equating to more than 4.5 million tonnes. While, in Europe, over-ordering caused by poor demand prediction contributes to $50 billion of <\/span><span class=\"il\" style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">fresh<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> food being thrown away by retailers each year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Food waste is also a huge contributor to climate change, generating what end up being totally unnecessary carbon emissions, which means shrinking wastage here isn&#8217;t just about optimizing retailer profits &#8212; it&#8217;s super important if humanity is to successfully tackle climate change.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2304495\" style=\"width: 2186px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2304495\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2304495 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Freshflow-founding-team.png\" alt=\"Freshflow founding team\" width=\"2176\" height=\"1458\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Freshflow-founding-team.png 2176w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Freshflow-founding-team.png?resize=150,101 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Freshflow-founding-team.png?resize=300,201 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Freshflow-founding-team.png?resize=768,515 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Freshflow-founding-team.png?resize=680,456 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Freshflow-founding-team.png?resize=1536,1029 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Freshflow-founding-team.png?resize=2048,1372 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Freshflow-founding-team.png?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2176px) 100vw, 2176px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2304495\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Freshflow co-founders Carmine Paolino (L) and Avik Mukhija. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Freshflow<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The Berlin-based startup, which was founded just over a year ago, isn&#8217;t alone in spotting the opportunity to apply machine learning techniques such as probabilistic modelling to fresh food ordering. It&#8217;s competing with a number of U.S. startups like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/19\/afresh-has-a-100-million-valuation-and-a-software-service-that-keeps-food-fresh-in-grocery-stores\/\">Afresh<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/21\/shelf-engine-has-a-plan-to-reduce-food-waste-at-grocery-stores-and-12-million-in-new-cash-to-see-i\/\">Shelf Engine<\/a>. While in Europe, the competitive field looks a bit thinner but there are more generalist retail demand planning platforms like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/06\/retail-technology-platform-relex-raises-200m-from-tcv\/\">Relex<\/a> &#8212; as well as, of course, the German ERP giant SAP &#8212; but Freshflow argues that its dedicated focus on fresh produce gives it an edge for fresh groceries versus less specialist demand forecasters.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond that, another differentiating factor it claims is around ease of integration for retailers. Freshflow&#8217;s platform is designed to sit as a layer on top of retailers&#8217; existing ERP systems &#8212; and Mukhija says customers can be up and running with the platform in about a month.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the key properties of Freshflow is that integration is super lightweight,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Usually when supermarkets are onboarding new IT systems it&#8217;s several months or several years of integration time that needs to happen. Because they have very outdated ERP systems and there&#8217;s no proper IO\/APIs that they have.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;With Freshflow we are able to onboard them within one month &#8212; and the reason is we are a lightweight layer on top of their existing ERP system so there&#8217;s no need to integrate specifically. We work off of data pipelines that deliver us data out of their system.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>On the store floor, the product takes the form of an iPad app that is used by the produce team &#8212; informing them of the recommended restocking levels per product. This reordering process is intended to be largely automated by Freshflow&#8217;s app but the human staff can step in and override the AI&#8217;s recommendation for a particular product order if required.<\/p>\n<p>Freshflow says its system is live with one of Germany&#8217;s largest grocery retailers, as well as with an Eastern European quick commerce player. It&#8217;s not naming any customers as yet but, when pressed, tells us the SaaS is live in four stores in total.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s announcing a \u20ac1.7 million seed funding round today, led by German venture fund Capnamic and European climate tech VC, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/26\/world-fund-is-a-new-e350m-climate-vc-fund-incubated-by-green-search-engine-ecosia\/\">World Fund<\/a> &#8212; with a number of strategic angel investors also participating, including Alexander Mrozek CEO at Dr. Oetker Digital and Jens Fiege and Felix Fiege, CEOs at FIEGE Logistics &#8212; and says it intends to use the new financing to expand its footprint in Europe with the goal of getting its SaaS into 100 stores.<\/p>\n<p>Commenting on Freshflow&#8217;s seed raise in a statement, Tim Schumacher, general partner at World Fund, said: \u201cAlmost 40% of all food produced globally is wasted and this is causing six times the carbon impact as the entire aviation industry worldwide. That\u2019s what makes <span class=\"il\">Freshflow<\/span>\u2019s goals so admirable and was such a key reason that we at World Fund wanted to support them. Avik and Carmine have developed a very exciting state-of-the-art AI engine which is already seeing remarkable results and I have no doubt that the future is very bright for <span class=\"il\">Freshflow<\/span>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In another supporting statement, Dorothea Gotthardt, investment manager at Capnamic Ventures, added: \u201cAt Capnamic we were immediately impressed by the scale of ambition when it comes to Avik, Carmine and the team at <span class=\"il\">Freshflow<\/span>. Tackling the issue of food waste at the same time as boosting a retailer\u2019s bottom line is an eye-catching proposition and given the results so far, one they are clearly delivering on. The sooner they can expand across the continent the better it will be for retailers and consumers. I can\u2019t wait to see where <span class=\"il\">Freshflow<\/span> goes in the next 12 months.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Freshflow also previously took in some pre-seed funding via the Berlin-based Entrepreneur First accelerator program where its two co-founders &#8212; who both have a background in machine learning &#8212; met and decided to join forces around the idea.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our AI works from a combination of data that comes from the stores &#8212; from the retailers &#8212; we have sales data, ordering data, we have shrink [produce wastage] data, we have the data about the products \u2026 sometimes also nutritional info, all kinds of information we get from them. We also get external information such as the weather data. And sometimes also location data &#8212; if there are local events and stuff. And we combine it all together in our machine learning models,&#8221; says Paolino, explaining how the AI cooks up its demand predictions.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Also we use probabilistic inventory that basically knows what are the shelf lives on the products. Which is one of the biggest challenges in our space &#8212; especially with perishable products &#8212; because we&#8217;re able to actually model the shelf lives on the data that we get from supermarkets and this is because every single supermarket handles fresh products in a different way.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Paolino gives the example of a store leaving a certain type of vegetable unrefrigerated (say after it arrives and before it&#8217;s shelved and\/or put into cold storage) even for a relatively short period of time, which may nonetheless substantially impact the overall shelf life for that product &#8212; meaning that&#8217;s another variable the system needs to factor in.<\/p>\n<p>To do that, Freshflow isn&#8217;t in the store surveillance business; rather it&#8217;s working backward from data points the supermarkets provide as part of their standard produce tracking processes &#8212; i.e., information on unsold\/spoiled fresh food which, combined with data on when that produce arrived at the store, can be used to probabilistically predict shelf life.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;So we have this machine learning system that figures out by itself the self lives of products &#8212; then we have an inventory that is probabilistic and we know more or less what is in the inventory and we combine it all together in our machine learning model to essentially predict what should they order,&#8221; adds Paolino.<\/p>\n<p>Freshflow expects its predictions to further improve over time, as they ingest more data by onboarding more customers &#8212; and as customers use the system and feed back more data points (including, for example, any staff decisions to override a restocking suggestion) &#8212; as its algorithms get better at understanding the longevity of perishable goods and at predicting human demand for fresh foodstuffs.<\/p>\n<p>It also points to steadily increasing consumer demand for fresh produce &#8212; while noting that supermarkets&#8217; cold storage space remains fixed &#8212; hence the team predicts growing demand from grocery retailers for smarter approaches to replenishing these sought for fresh goods.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Especially when you&#8217;re looking at brick-and-mortar retailers, their revenue in fresh products is the only product category that&#8217;s actually increasing versus online because people like to go inside the store and buy fresh stuff. And storage space is obviously remaining the same size,&#8221; adds Mukhija. &#8220;We&#8217;ve noticed that with our existing clients; those cold storage rooms go full very quickly and then things go bad very quickly too, obviously.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The startup&#8217;s longer-term vision is to expand from serving customer-facing grocery retailers to warehousing facilities, suppliers and even, ultimately, farmers &#8212; with a goal of automating the whole <span class=\"il\">fresh<\/span> food supply chain and reducing global food waste by 50%. Or, well, that&#8217;s the moonshot.<\/p>\n<p>Couldn&#8217;t supermarkets do this kind of predictive modelling themselves &#8212; given they already own a lot of the core data needed to train forecasting AIs in the vagaries of perishable groceries?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Generally supermarkets do what they do best and this is how we see the future in the retail world,&#8221; replies Mukhija. &#8220;We always hear this from store managers &#8212; they want to make sure they&#8217;re attending to their customers. That the fresh produce section looks really nice and presentable and a lot of quality checking is going on on the shelves. But they don&#8217;t want to be spending time doing data analytics and building AI teams in-house. It&#8217;s extremely expensive &#8212; you&#8217;re reinventing the wheel every time. And it&#8217;s also hard to attract top notch AI talent.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Paolino also chips in on that to say Freshflow is planning to experiment with applying reinforcement learning technology to its AI-powered predictions, emphasizing: &#8220;And that is really, really hard to do &#8212; also for retailers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"zlY0TVC6BU\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/26\/world-fund-is-a-new-e350m-climate-vc-fund-incubated-by-green-search-engine-ecosia\/\">World Fund is a new \u20ac350M climate VC fund incubated by green search engine Ecosia<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;World Fund is a new \u20ac350M climate VC fund incubated by green search engine Ecosia&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/26\/world-fund-is-a-new-e350m-climate-vc-fund-incubated-by-green-search-engine-ecosia\/embed\/#?secret=0fC07DGcsL#?secret=zlY0TVC6BU\" data-secret=\"zlY0TVC6BU\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qurNNqeEDK\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/25\/grocery-delivery-startup-membo-is-hungry-to-build-a-europe-wide-local-food-producer-network\/\">Grocery delivery startup Membo is hungry to build a Europe-wide, local food producer network<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Grocery delivery startup Membo is hungry to build a Europe-wide, local food producer network&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/25\/grocery-delivery-startup-membo-is-hungry-to-build-a-europe-wide-local-food-producer-network\/embed\/#?secret=CVZZz1mZS0#?secret=qurNNqeEDK\" data-secret=\"qurNNqeEDK\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For years grocery retailers have been using data driven forecasting to help them predict demand to figure out which products to reorder to keep shelves stocked.

bolts on E2EE email via a plug-in for enterprise software"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Swiss-Hungarian end-to-end encrypted cloud services provider <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/04\/tresorit-series-b\/\">Tresorit <\/a>has added a new string to its security bow: It&#8217;s started offering E2E encrypted email as a subscription add-on for business users of third-party email service providers.<\/p>\n<p>Tresorit&#8217;s E2EE module enables subscribers to send and receive strongly encrypted email messages via their usual email provider &#8212; with the level of security enhanced as the plug-in is wrapped in the same zero-knowledge promise Tresorit claims for its file storage and sharing products.<\/p>\n<p>How does the tool work? The Tresorit account holder downloads and installs the plug-in, which integrates with their existing email client. From launch it&#8217;s available for Microsoft Outlook but further integrations are planned, including with Gmail.<\/p>\n<p>An Outlook user can access the function by clicking on the &#8220;Email Encryption&#8221; button that&#8217;s displayed in the top left corner, per a spokeswoman.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;All emails and attachments sent with Tresorit\u2019s email encryption as well as the replies sent to these (regardless of whether the sender of the reply has a Tresorit account) will be end-to-end encrypted with the encryption technology used in Tresorit\u2019s cloud storage and file-sharing app. This means, no one besides the sender and the recipient is able to read them,&#8221; she told us.<\/p>\n<p>Email users who are not themselves Tresorit subscribers themselves but want to send an E2EE email reply to an E2EE email sent via Tresorit are able to do so without needing to have an account.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is possible because replies are encrypted in the sender\u2019s browser,&#8221; explains the spokeswoman. &#8220;This ensures that reply emails are end-to-end encrypted even when sent by someone who doesn\u2019t have a Tresorit account. As opposed to E2EE email services, this enables E2EE communication even with a recipient who doesn\u2019t have a Tresorit account.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;If someone without a Tresorit account receives an email sent with our email encryption service, [they receive] an encrypted email template with a reference\/link to the end-to-end encrypted content (this is similar to our file sharing service Send). By clicking on the link, the recipient can access the decrypted email content in the browser after certain security checks that prevent the email service provider to intercept the content.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Currently, we use email validation as a security guarantee (we are sending a code to the email address that the user has to paste into the Tresorit website in the browser), and we are planning to add new methods (password provided by the sender, authentication with public SSO providers),&#8221; she adds.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">A recipient who&#8217;s not a Tresorit subscriber can also send an E2EE reply via an editor in the same browser &#8212; by clicking on the &#8220;Secure reply&#8221; option in the body of the E2EE email they received from the Tresorit user.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The original sender receives an email about the reply but as [they have] a Tresorit account and installed plugin it enables us to download the content of the reply from our servers, decrypt it locally and display it to the sender in their email client in a secure and transparent way,&#8221; the spokeswoman adds.<\/p>\n<p>The E2EE email plug-in is being targeted at enterprise users &#8212; which means Tresorit us not competing directly with E2E webmail provider <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/09\/protonmail-gets-a-slick-new-look-as-privacy-tech-eyes-the-mainstream\/\">ProtonMail<\/a> that is focused on consumers or smaller businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Larger businesses are of course unlikely to want to migrate away from industry email provider staples like Outlook just to get E2E encryption so Tresorit&#8217;s approach brings E2E encryption to their existing email client.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019re targeting bigger companies already using an email service such as Outlook. Our goal is to integrate end-to-end encryption of emails in existing workflows and make it very easy to send emails securely. Beyond this, we focus on industries that handle a lot of confidential data and have to comply with strict data protection regulations (legal, healthcare, finance and HR, R&amp;D, IT),&#8221; the spokeswoman notes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Currently, we\u2019re working on making our email encryption work with all major email services such as Gmail (by the end of 2022) and supporting all operating systems and platforms (Mac, Windows, etc.) From a technology perspective, our solution is agnostic of what email service the user uses (O365, Gmail, etc.).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Instead of a standalone email service, our strategy is to develop end-to-end encrypted tools that easily integrate with workflows and services already used by companies. We aren&#8217;t targeting users looking for a whole new email client. We would like to enable companies already using mainstream web clients to add a further level of security to their tools, so they don&#8217;t have to roll-out new email addresses to their entire employee base,&#8221; she adds.<\/p>\n<p>Pricing for Tresorit&#8217;s E2EE email tool costs \u20ac5 per user per month when paid annually and \u20ac6.25 per user per month paid in a monthly plan (on top of the Tresorit subscription fee).<\/p>\n<p>It is also offering a trial period &#8212; of 14 days for new customers and between 30 and 90 days for existing customers, depending on their subscription package.<\/p>\n<p>Commenting in a statement, Istvan Lam, CEO, and co-founder, said:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Our vision is to make cloud collaboration both secure and user-friendly with the power of end-to-encryption and help our users protect their digital valuables. We\u2019re bringing our 10-year expertise in cloud encryption to emailing now: our email service is the next big step in creating a secure, end-to-end encrypted workspace for businesses of all sizes.<\/p>\n<p>In the past year, we have shifted our focus to serve enterprise clients and have learned that 90% of them rely on Tresorit to share data with clients, partners, and auditors outside their organization. Our new email encryption service is our solution to meet this demand.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"CGo3BKTmMD\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/08\/swiss-post-acquires-e2e-encrypted-cloud-services-provider-tresorit\/\">Swiss Post acquires e2e encrypted cloud services provider, Tresorit<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Swiss Post acquires e2e encrypted cloud services provider, Tresorit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/08\/swiss-post-acquires-e2e-encrypted-cloud-services-provider-tresorit\/embed\/#?secret=7kjbAzg2zF#?secret=CGo3BKTmMD\" data-secret=\"CGo3BKTmMD\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ntIDBgnw6q\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/09\/protonmail-gets-a-slick-new-look-as-privacy-tech-eyes-the-mainstream\/\">ProtonMail gets a slick new look, as privacy tech eyes the mainstream<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;ProtonMail gets a slick new look, as privacy tech eyes the mainstream&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/09\/protonmail-gets-a-slick-new-look-as-privacy-tech-eyes-the-mainstream\/embed\/#?secret=uyXJGM6A9C#?secret=ntIDBgnw6q\" data-secret=\"ntIDBgnw6q\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Swiss-Hungarian end-to-end encrypted cloud services provider Tresorit has added a new string to its security bow: It&#8217;s started offering E2E encrypted email as a subscription add-on for business users of third-party email service providers.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/23\/europe-will-finally-legislate-for-a-common-charger-for-mobiles\/\">proposal<\/a> announced last fall, ahead of a full vote by the parliament next month to confirm how it will negotiate with Member State governments on the detail of the legislation.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.consilium.europa.eu\/en\/press\/press-releases\/2022\/01\/26\/council-approves-a-common-charger-for-electronic-devices\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Council adopted its position<\/a> on the common charger proposal back in January.<\/p>\n<p>The IMCO committee voted 43:2 in favor of a negotiation position that will push to standardize charger ports for a range of mobile devices on USB Type-C, including smartphones, tablets, handheld games consoles, e-readers, digital cameras, electronic toys and more &#8212; with\u00a0MEPs voting to expand the original proposal to cover laptops, among other additional products.<\/p>\n<p>The committee backed exemptions for devices when they are too small to house this type of port &#8212; such as smart watches, health trackers and some sports equipment. Although larger devices in those categories would still be in scope under this amended version of the proposal.<\/p>\n<p>MEPs also voted to press the Commission to address growing use of wireless charging &#8212; a development that could enable device makers to circumvent charger port rules &#8212; by presenting a strategy that allows for &#8220;minimum interoperability&#8221; of any new charging solutions by the end of 2026.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The goal is to avoid a new fragmentation in the market, to continue to reduce environmental waste, ensure consumer convenience and avoid so-called \u201clock-in\u201d effects created by proprietary charging solutions,&#8221; it said in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.europarl.europa.eu\/news\/en\/press-room\/20220412IPR27115\/common-charger-meps-agree-on-proposal-to-reduce-electronic-waste\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">press release<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>MEPs were also focused on labelling, saying they want to see clear information on new devices about charging options and whether a product includes a charger or not to support consumers in making more sustainable purchasing decisions to reduce the amount of new e-waste generated.<\/p>\n<p>Parliamentarians have been pressing the bloc&#8217;s executive body to legislate to tackle e-waste for years. However the Commission preferred to pursue an approach of engaging with the industry to get to a common charger voluntarily.<\/p>\n<p>And while there has been a reduction in proprietary chargers over the years there still isn&#8217;t a single charger that&#8217;s compatible with all in-scope devices. Hence the EU&#8217;s executive body finally came forward with a legislative proposal last year.<\/p>\n<p>Commenting on the IMCO vote in a statement, rapporteur Alex Agius Saliba said: \u201cWith half a billion chargers for portable devices shipped in Europe each year, generating 11,000 to 13,000 tonnes of e-waste, a single charger for mobile phones and other small and medium electronic devices would benefit everyone. It will help the environment, further help the re-use of old electronics, save money, and reduce unnecessary costs and inconvenience for both businesses and consumers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are proposing a truly comprehensive policy intervention, building on the Commission\u2019s proposal by calling for the interoperability of wireless charging technologies by 2026 and improving information given to consumers with dedicated labels. We are also expanding the proposal\u2019s scope by adding more products, such as laptops, that will need to comply with the new rules.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"9O4ntbTcSd\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/23\/europe-will-finally-legislate-for-a-common-charger-for-mobiles\/\">Europe will finally legislate for a common charger for mobiles<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Europe will finally legislate for a common charger for mobiles&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/23\/europe-will-finally-legislate-for-a-common-charger-for-mobiles\/embed\/#?secret=SODS2MEQAG#?secret=9O4ntbTcSd\" data-secret=\"9O4ntbTcSd\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"71F8NS1Ady\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/30\/eu-expands-ecodesign-rules\/\">Europe lays out expanded ecodesign rules with plan for digital product passports<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Europe lays out expanded ecodesign rules with plan for digital product passports&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/30\/eu-expands-ecodesign-rules\/embed\/#?secret=znI411tXRr#?secret=71F8NS1Ady\" data-secret=\"71F8NS1Ady\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>European Union lawmakers have taken a step closer to agreeing on rules to standardize how a range of mobile gadgetry is charged.

targets fake reviews and killer acquisitions in reform package"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The UK has announced a bundle of consumer protection and competition reforms which could see platforms that fail to tackle fake reviews fined up to 10% of their global annual turnover.<\/p>\n<p>Also incoming: Stronger powers for the national competition regulator to prevent tech giants from being able to buy up startups or smaller rivals with the intention of shuttering a competing service (so called &#8216;killer acquisitions&#8217;).<\/p>\n<p>However the government still hasn&#8217;t decided how to deal with the broad online scourge of dark pattern design which uses deceptive and\/or manipulative tactics to dupe web users into spending more time or money than they intend on a digital service &#8212; saying it&#8217;s &#8220;seeking further evidence&#8221; on how best to arm regulators to combat these unethical tactics.<\/p>\n<p>The reforms it has agreed follow a consultation last year on reforming competition and consumer policy which saw the government take feedback from businesses, consumers groups, regulators and others on how to strengthen legislation in these areas.<\/p>\n<h2>Consumer protection &amp; competition reforms<\/h2>\n<p>In a response to the consultation <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/consultations\/reforming-competition-and-consumer-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">published<\/a> by the department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy (BEIS) today, the government said policies it&#8217;s proposing fall into three areas: Competition reforms to ensure the system is &#8220;fit for the digital age&#8221;; consumer rights reforms to keep pace with digital developments and tackle specific issues like fake reviews; and consumer enforcement reforms to empower the national antitrust watchdog to intervene effectively.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/news\/new-rules-to-protect-consumers-hard-earned-cash\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">press release<\/a> announcing the package of reforms this morning, BEIS said the plan would make it &#8220;clearly illegal&#8221; to pay someone to write or host a fake review.<\/p>\n<p>There will also be &#8220;clearer rules&#8221; for businesses to make it easier for consumers to opt out of subscriptions so they are not stuck paying for things they no longer want.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>So called &#8216;subscription traps&#8217; &#8212; in which businesses make it difficult for consumers to exit a contract\u00a0 &#8212; will also be targeted by new rules that companies must:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide clearer information to consumers before they enter a subscription contract<\/li>\n<li>issue a reminder to consumers that a free trial or low-cost introductory offer is coming to an end, and a reminder before a contract auto-renews onto a new term<\/li>\n<li>ensure consumers can exit a contract in a straightforward, cost-effective and timely way<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In a major change, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will be able to directly enforce consumer law under the reform plan, rather than needing to go through a court process &#8212; with the aim of dialling up the speed of enforcement.<\/p>\n<p>The watchdog will get new powers to fine firms up to 10% of their global turnover for &#8220;mistreating customers&#8221;, as BEIS put it,\u00a0or up to \u00a3300,000 in the case of an individual.<\/p>\n<p>It will also be able to award compensation to consumers, instead of that being the preserve of the courts.<\/p>\n<p>There will also be measures aimed at helping consumers and traders resolve more disputes without needing to go to court &#8212; by improving Alternative Dispute Resolution (<abbr title=\"Alternative Dispute Resolution\">ADR<\/abbr>) services in consumer markets, including via amendments to regulation intended to improve ADR services, per BEIS.<\/p>\n<p>The government says the average UK household spends around \u00a3900 each year influenced by online reviews &#8212; and \u00a360 on &#8220;unwanted subscriptions&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The slated consumer protection reforms will apply in England, Scotland and Wales (the area is devolved in Northern Ireland).<\/p>\n<p>In a statement, consumer minister Paul Scully said:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We\u2019re making sure consumer protections keep pace with a modern, digitised economy.\u202f No longer will you visit a 5 star-reviewed restaurant only to find a burnt lasagne or get caught in a subscription in which there\u2019s no end in sight. Consumers deserve better and the majority of businesses out there doing the right thing deserve protection from rogue traders undermining them.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear when exactly these new powers will come in. Legislation will need to be formally proposed and presented to parliament to undergo the usual process of scrutiny before it can become law and enter into force.<\/p>\n<p>Prime minister Boris Johnson&#8217;s government also does not have the greatest record on swiftly legislating in these areas (consumer protection and competition) so it could be several years before new rules apply.<\/p>\n<h2>Fake reviews<\/h2>\n<p>On fake reviews, the government says it will consult on a new law to tackle f<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">ake reviews that would make it illegal to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>commission someone to write or submit a fake review<\/li>\n<li>host consumer reviews without taking reasonable steps to check they are genuine<\/li>\n<li>offer or advertise to submit, commission or facilitate fake reviews<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In terms of the impact on platforms and marketplaces much will depend on exactly what &#8220;reasonable steps&#8221; boils down to in that context.<\/p>\n<p>More thorough checks would be more expensive for platforms to implement. But if the measures are too weak and easy for scammers to circumvent it&#8217;ll be consumers left disappointed that fake reviews continue to proliferate.<\/p>\n<p>The CMA &#8212; which has been broadly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/news\/cma-seeks-information-on-online-reviews-and-endorsements\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">investigating online reviews since 2015<\/a> &#8212; has instigated a number of interventions against platforms on the issue of fake reviews specifically in recent years, including actions targeted at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/21\/ebay-and-facebook-told-to-tackle-trade-in-fake-reviews\/\">eBay<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/08\/facebook-and-ebay-pledge-to-do-more-to-tackle-trade-in-fake-reviews-after-pressure-from-uk-regulator\/\">Facebook<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/25\/amazon-and-google-face-uk-cma-probe-over-fake-reviews\/\">Amazon and Google<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"INjhcv8lDs\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/09\/facebook-takes-down-16000-groups-trading-fake-reviews-after-another-poke-by-uks-cma\/\">Facebook takes down 16,000 groups trading fake reviews after another poke by UK&#8217;s CMA<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook takes down 16,000 groups trading fake reviews after another poke by UK&#8217;s CMA&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/09\/facebook-takes-down-16000-groups-trading-fake-reviews-after-another-poke-by-uks-cma\/embed\/#?secret=TDfJvnDsW4#?secret=INjhcv8lDs\" data-secret=\"INjhcv8lDs\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>It has also expressed frustration with certain companies over their slow response to pressure to stop the trade in fake reviews, with CMA CEO Andrea Coscelli saying <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/09\/facebook-takes-down-16000-groups-trading-fake-reviews-after-another-poke-by-uks-cma\/\">last year<\/a> that it was &#8220;disappointing&#8221; Facebook had taken over a year to fix issues the regulator had flagged, for example.<\/p>\n<p>A threat of fines that could &#8212; under the government&#8217;s reform plan &#8212; stretch into billions of dollars for a tech giant like Facebook would be more likely to concentrate C-suite minds on compliance with this issue.<\/p>\n<p>Commenting in a statement on the full package of reforms, Coscelli said:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is an important milestone towards strengthening the <abbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\">CMA<\/abbr>\u2019s ability to hold companies to account, promote fair and open markets, and protect UK consumers. The <abbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\">CMA<\/abbr> stands ready to assist the government to ensure that legislation can be brought forward as quickly as possible, so consumers and businesses can benefit.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It may be that Facebook is also the inspiration for other planned changes to beef up penalties for breaches.<\/p>\n<p>These reforms will see the regulator able to impose fines worth up to 5% of a business&#8217; annual global turnover (as well as additional daily penalties for continued non-compliance) for breaches of undertakings given to it<abbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\">; and able to levy <\/abbr>penalties worth up to 1% of a business\u2019 annual global turnover (plus additional daily penalties if the breach continues) in the case of <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">non-compliance with an information notice, concealing evidence or providing false information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s notable after Facebook was fined $70M by the CMA <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/20\/facebook-fined-70m-for-flouting-giphy-order-made-by-uk-watchdog\/\">last year <\/a>for deliberately withholding information related to the regulator&#8217;s oversight of its acquisition of Giphy &#8212; the first such finding of a breach of an order by a company \u201cconsciously refusing to report all the required information\u201d, as the CMA put it at the time.<\/p>\n<p>The regulator subsequently <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/30\/faecbook-giphy-cma-order\/\">ordered Facebook to undo the Giphy purchase<\/a> &#8212; which was also the first time the CMA had blocked such a major digital acquisition.<\/p>\n<h2>Killer acquisitions<\/h2>\n<p>The tech giant&#8217;s power to inspire major regulatory reforms looks undeniably &#8212; given the government also intends to beef up the watchdog&#8217;s powers to combat killer acquisitions. (Facebook had shut down Giphy&#8217;s competing ad product after buying the smaller business, triggering competition concerns, an in depth probe and, finally, an order to reverse the acquisition.)<\/p>\n<p>Other measures slated as incoming through the reform package include powers to strengthen the CMA&#8217;s ability to gather evidence to combat cartel-style anticompetitive behavior where companies colluding to bump up prices, per BEIS.<\/p>\n<p>The CMA will also be empowered to fine businesses for anticompetitive abuses even in smaller markets as the government says it will reduce the minimum turnover threshold for immunity from financial penalties from \u00a350M to \u00a320M.<\/p>\n<p>Smaller businesses will see some relief in the form of a government pledge to cut their M&amp;A red tape by excluding mergers between small businesses &#8212; where each party\u2019s UK turnover is less than \u00a310M &#8212; from the <abbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\">CMA<\/abbr>\u2019s merger control altogether.<\/p>\n<p>More details on the competition components of the reform are contained in the government response to the consultation &#8212; where it writes that it is progressing the following policies:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>retaining a voluntary and non-suspensory merger control regime<\/li>\n<li>adjusting the thresholds for the <abbr title=\"Competition and Markets Authority\">CMA<\/abbr>\u2019s jurisdiction to better target the mergers most likely to cause harm and ensure the regime remains proportionate:\n<ul>\n<li>Raising the turnover threshold in line with inflation (&gt;\u00a370m to &gt;\u00a3100m UK turnover)<\/li>\n<li>Creating an additional basis for establishing jurisdiction to enable review of so-called \u2018killer acquisition\u2019 and other mergers which do not involve direct competitors.

it added.<\/p>\n<h2>Moving like sludge&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>While the UK government continues to consider how best to tackle dark pattern design, EU lawmakers have a chance to take the lead and ban these manipulative tactics in already proposed legislation &#8212; assuming <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/13\/dsa-beuc\/\">the Council agrees with MEPs to include a prohibition on such practices in the Digital Services Act<\/a> (another &#8216;trilogue&#8217; compromise negotiation is scheduled for tomorrow so the issue is still a live one for the bloc).<\/p>\n<p>The EU also <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/24\/dma-political-agreement\/\">already agreed<\/a> a major ex ante reform of competition law to target tech giants &#8212; aka, the Digital Markets Act &#8212; which is expected to come into force later this year.<\/p>\n<p>While the UK&#8217;s own slated <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/27\/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech\/\">&#8216;pro-competition&#8217;

market abuses, meaning the CMA has to tackle market power related problems using classic (slow) competition powers.<\/p>\n<p>A UK government claim to be &#8220;moving in a more agile way than the EU, whilst maintaining high standards&#8221; &#8212; penned by the BEIS secretary in his ministerial forward to the response to the consultation outcome &#8212; looks questionable in light of how little progress has been made in bringing legislation forward to deliver on the long-trailed promise of a major competition reboot.<\/p>\n<p>The CMA has been investigating a number of concerns about the market power of tech giants in recent years &#8212; including undertaking a market study of online advertising <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/12\/18\/uks-competition-regulator-asks-for-views-on-breaking-up-google\/\">back in 2019<\/a> which concluded there were serious structural problems linked to the dominance of Google and Meta\/Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>However the regulator eschewed intervening when it reported its concerns &#8212; opting to wait for the government to the reform competition regime.<\/p>\n<p>Another ongoing CMA market study &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/14\/cma-mobile-ecosystem-market-study\/\">examining the Apple, Google mobile duopoly<\/a> &#8212; has also raised substantial competition concerns but, again, the regulator has suggested these issues are best tackled by the DMU once it&#8217;s empowered, meaning that the structural remedies needed to tackle serious competition issues remain on pause.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"UHLx8WtTPa\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/25\/how-europe-has-expanded-its-bid-to-disrupt-big-tech\/\">How Europe has expanded its bid to disrupt Big Tech<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute;
