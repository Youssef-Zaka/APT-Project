                    <h2>What is a computer?</h2>

<p>A computer is any machine that can be programmed to carry out a set of <a href="https://www.idtech.com/blog/algorithms-for-kids">algorithms</a> and arithmetic instructions. </p>

<p>Of course, the computers we think of today are so much more than that—and I’m talking beyond just being machines used to play games and watch videos of cats on the internet!</p>

<h2>5 parts of a computer</h2>

<p>Whether it's a gaming system or a home PC, the five main components that make up a typical, present-day computer include:</p>

<ul><li>A motherboard</li>
    <li>A Central Processing Unit (CPU)</li>
    <li>A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), also known as a video card</li>
    <li>Random Access Memory (RAM), also known as volatile memory</li>
    <li>Storage: Solid State Drive (SSD) or Hard Disk Drive (HDD)</li>
</ul><p><img alt="animated diagram of computer parts" src="https://2018media.idtech.com/2021-05/computer-parts-diagram.png?f9a309a218" style="width: 800px; height: 500px;"></p>

<p>In terms of construction, each of these main components are attached to the motherboard and then put into a protective case—resembling the clean, polished look most of us are accustomed to seeing. </p>

<p>Sure, most computers have their own distinct design - and different brands of hardware installed - but the components listed above are standard across all computers. </p>

<p><em><strong>Important</strong></em>: A quick note before we dive into the details—I’m listing and talking about the different components of a computer. This is by no means intended to be an invitation to disassemble your computer, nor is it a set of instructions to do so. Without the proper knowledge, you can severely damage your computer, and importantly, doing so is unsafe. </p>

<h3>1. Motherboard</h3>

<p><em>What it is</em>: All components of a computer communicate through a circuit board called the motherboard, as was mentioned above. </p>

<p><em>What it does</em>: Think of the motherboard as the glue that holds everything else together.</p>

<p>The motherboard’s video card and Central Processing Unit are contained in an integrated (built-in) chipset, shown in the picture below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://2018media.idtech.com/2019-07/motherboard-1.jpg?461dd4763f" style="width: 800px; height: 530px;"></p>

<p>This is where input/output devices such as a keyboard, mouse, and speakers get plugged in.</p>

<h3>2. Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>

<p><em>What it is</em>: The CPU is often called the "brain" of a computer, thanks to its direct plug connection to the motherboard, and communication with all of the computer’s other components.</p>

<div id="om-r9paevm5qowapqzvy8xt-holder"></div>

<p><em>What it does</em>: Whenever you write a line of code (in <a href="https://www.idtech.com/courses/intro-to-coding-for-machine-learning">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.idtech.com/blog/java-for-kids-a-guide-for-parents-of-new-coders">Java</a>, <a href="https://www.idtech.com/courses/code-apps-with-c">C++</a>, or any other <a href="https://www.idtech.com/blog/choose-best-programming-language-your-child">programming language</a>), it's broken down into assembly language—which is a language that the processor can understand. It fetches, decodes, and executes these instructions.</p>

<p>And that’s where the CPU comes in—all the processes a computer handles are taken care of by the CPU.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://2018media.idtech.com/2019-07/cpu-1.jpg?2639e5ecb2" style="width: 800px; height: 494px;"></p>

<h3>3. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)</h3>

<p><em>What it is</em>: It's not uncommon to hear gamers obsess over the next new graphics card, as these graphic cards make it possible for computers to generate high-end visuals like those found in the many <a href="https://www.idtech.com/blog/different-types-of-video-game-genres">different types of video games</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to video games, though, good graphics cards also come in handy for those who rely on images in order to execute their craft, like 3D modelers using resource-intensive software.</p>

<p><em>What it does</em>: Graphics cards often communicate directly with the display monitor, meaning a $1,000 graphics card won't be of much use if there isn't a high-end monitor connected to it.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://2018media.idtech.com/2019-07/gpu-1.jpg?61456f98e9" style="width: 768px; height: 409px;"></p>

<h3>4. Random Access Memory (RAM)</h3>

<p><em>What it is</em>: RAM, also known as volatile memory, stores data regarding frequently accessed programs and processes. (It's called volatile memory because it gets erased every time the computer restarts.)</p>

<p><em>What it does</em>: RAM helps programs and games start up and close quickly.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://2018media.idtech.com/2019-07/ram.jpg?95bb65ecfa" style="width: 800px; height: 248px;"></p>

<h3>5. Storage</h3>

<p><em>What it is</em>: All computers need somewhere to store their data. Modern computers either use a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) or Solid State Drive (SSD).</p>

<p><em>What it does</em>: HDDs are made of an actual disk onto which data is stored. The disk is read by a mechanical arm. (HDDs are cheaper than SSDs, but are slowly becoming more and more obsolete.)</p>

<p>SSDs (think SIM cards) have no moving parts and are faster than a hard drive, because no time is spent waiting for a mechanical arm to find data on a physical location on the disk.</p>

<h2>Fun, right?</h2>

<p>Some enjoy computers from the frontend, spending time on YouTube, shopping on eBay, and playing video games (and <a href="https://www.idtech.com/blog/video-games-are-good-for-you">experiencing the benefits of doing so</a>.). </p>

<p>But for others, it’s the “how” that proves to be more intriguing! Taking computers apart and putting them back together, adding new hardware, troubleshooting hardware assembly, and booting them up (and crossing their fingers!) is all part of such intrigue. </p>

<p>Does the latter sound like your child? </p>

<p>Our “build your own laptop” courses offer introductions to hardware, engineering, and coding, offering students the opportunity to assemble laptops, code with Python to create games, and use the Linux OS. All of this also improves soft skills like project-planning and hands-on coordination!</p>

<p>To learn more, check out our <a href="https://www.idtech.com/courses/intro-to-coding-for-machine-learning">Python Coding Summer Camp</a>  (for Machine Learning; ages 13-17)</p>

<p>Outside of summer, kids can still get hands-on with coding and micro:bit in online private lessons (micro:bit Included), working with JavaScript or visual coding to turn on lights and power different components. </p>

<strong>Media Release: </strong>As a condition of participation, you authorize iD Tech and its partners to take photos, videos, images, audio, and testimonials of you and your student and agree that said content may be used by iD Tech in promotional materials, marketing collateral, and online media. These images, testimonials, photos, videos, and audio may be shared and used by corporate partners, the media, or other organizations that work with iD Tech. You also agree that all projects and work created by your student during an iD Tech Program may be used by iD Tech in promotional materials, online, and other print media, and may be shared and used by corporate partners, the media, or other organizations that work with iD Tech. You understand that iD Tech, its owners, agents, partners, facility providers, and employees will not be held liable for damages and injuries associated with use of any content released herein, including any and all claims based on negligence. You agree that all images, testimonials, photos, video, and audio taken at or in connection with an iD Tech Program are the sole and exclusive property of iD Tech, and that iD Tech has a royalty-free, perpetual license to use copies of all student work and projects created at an iD Tech Program.</li>
    <li>
<strong>Name and Likeness Release:</strong> As a condition of participation, you authorize iD Tech and the press to use your student's full name and likeness in print, radio, TV, and other mediums.</li>
    <li>
<strong>Project/Hardware Release: </strong>Some iD Tech Programs are project-based. In such instances, iD Tech will attempt to provide your student with the knowledge to produce a working project. Some iD Tech Programs include take home hardware. In those instances, iD Tech will send home a product or voucher for a product. However, there will be instances when a project or product or product voucher cannot be sent home, posted or delivered, and you agree that iD Tech is not responsible if the game, project, product or voucher does not work properly and/or is not compatible with outside systems. You release iD Tech from any responsibility for failure to provide a copy of the project or product voucher, or a non-functioning/non-compatible/non-complete game, project, product voucher or product. Refunds will not be issued for not receiving products, product vouchers, or being provided a copy of the project, and/or non-functioning/non-compatible/non-complete projects, product vouchers or products. If you have issues with a product voucher or product, you must contact the manufacturer directly.

    <li>
<strong>Software Accounts: </strong>Some iD Tech Program activities require creation and/or use of an online account or require an online account to be created for your student. You consent to create or have iD Tech to create accounts as needed for your student to participate in Program activities. During non-instructional time, students may have access to websites that require accounts to be set up. While it is against iD Tech rules for students to set up accounts without their instructor’s permission, there may be instances where a student may create an account without the knowledge of iD Tech or its employees. In such instances, you release iD Tech and its employees from any and all responsibility and liability for accounts created by your student without iD Tech’s knowledge.</li>
    <li>
<strong>Game Ratings:</strong> iD Tech takes its corporate responsibility and family values very seriously. However, we cannot guarantee that younger students at iD Tech will avoid all contact with or mention of games rated "T" for Teen, or "M" for Mature. iD Tech will make a concerted effort to minimize both direct and indirect exposure to any games not rated for a student’s age group. Students attending courses designed for older ages have a greater chance of being exposed to materials rated for that older age group. If a student is attending a course for ages 13+, they may be exposed to games rated "M" for Mature by the ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board). You voluntarily assume any and all risks, known or unknown, associated with your student’s exposure to game content at an iD Tech Program.</li>
</ol>

Should any part of this contract be found invalid or not enforceable by a court of law, then the remaining portion shall continue to be valid and in force. You hereby acknowledge that you understand the terms of this ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, and you agree to comply with all of its terms and provisions.<br><br><strong>XII.  Rights Reserved</strong><br>

<p>Acts of discrimination or discriminatory harassment based upon an individual’s race, sex, color, religion, creed, national origin or ancestry, age, marital status, handicap, Vietnam-era status, or sexual orientation are a serious violation of University policy and will be dealt with promptly. Sexual harassment is illegal under both state and federal law. In some cases, it may be susceptible to prosecution under the criminal sexual conduct law.</p>

<p>Alcoholic beverages, illegal drugs, laser pens, fireworks, explosives, and all weapons are absolutely prohibited in the hall. It is against the law to tamper or misuse building fire alarm or fire-fighting equipment. Tampering with or misuse of elevator alarms, emergency call buttons or calling 911 from a room or elevator telephone, except in an emergency, is against the law. Penalties will be enforced.</p>

<p>Each room will be inspected prior to arrival and before departure and any damages to the room or to University property will be assessed and charged to the program, which may then be assessed to the participant. The room must be left in the same condition as it was during move in. Do not fasten anything to the walls or tamper with window screens. Excessive mess resulting in extra housekeeping hours will result in a charge to the program, and may be passed on to the student.</p>

<p>Appropriate behavior is expected at all times. Engaging in sexual contact with another student is a violation of our conduct policy. Leaving the program or residence hall without permission and appropriate supervision is a violation of our conduct policy. Bullying, taunting or threatening behavior toward other students is a violation of our conduct policy. Excessive noise or rowdiness will not be tolerated. Dangerous behavior, including fighting, is a violation and will not be tolerated. Throwing items out of residence hall windows is a conduct violation.</p>

<p>The use of candles, open flames, explosives, smoke bombs, “snaps”, or fireworks is dangerous and will not be tolerated in the residence halls, or at any U-M facility.</p>
