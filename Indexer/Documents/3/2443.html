The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next?

The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science.

The ancient Olympic Games are an early example of the contests in which humans have engaged to showcase physical prowess. In modern times, sports and games have evolved into a lucrative and competitive industry, while other leisure activities, such as card and video games, can be competitive or just serve as a way to unwind or socialize.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg","altText":"Sports & Recreation","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg"}},{"id":2000,"title":"Technology","urlTitle":"Technology","description":"Humankind has long striven to improve its living conditions through the development of tools, instruments, and transportation and communications systems, all with the goal of making our lives easier, more productive and—why not?—more fun, too.

To begin, designate the number of primes less than or equal to <em>n</em> by π(<em>n</em>). Thus π(10) = 4 because 2, 3, 5, and 7 are the four primes not exceeding 10. Similarly π(25) = 9 and π(100) = 25. Next, consider the proportion of numbers less than or equal to <em>n</em> that are prime—i.e., π(<em>n</em>)/<em>n</em>. Clearly π(10)/10 = 0.40, meaning that 40 percent of the numbers not exceeding 10 are prime. Other proportions are shown in the <span class="inline-table-wrapper"><span class="inline-table md-drag"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.britannica.com/14/77714-004-D28E8805/Prime-number-theorem.jpg" alt="prime number theorem" width="630" height="277"></span></span><span class="link-blue media-overlay-link asmref" data-href="/media/1/422325/71629">table</span>.</p><!--[P1]--><span class="marker p1"></span><!--[AM1]--><span class="marker AM1 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD1]--><span class="marker MOD1 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">A pattern is anything but clear, but the prime number theorem identifies one, at least approximately, and thereby provides a rule for the distribution of primes among the whole numbers. The theorem says that, for large <em>n</em>, the proportion π(<em>n</em>)/<em>n</em> is roughly 1/log <em>n</em>, where log <em>n</em> is the natural <span id="ref796480"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/logarithm" class="md-crosslink">logarithm</a> of <em>n</em>.

Along with classical and analytic number theory, scholars now explored specialized subfields such as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/algebraic-number" class="md-crosslink autoxref">algebraic number</a> theory, geometric number theory, and combinatorial number theory. The concepts became more abstract and the techniques more sophisticated.

Ramanujan, whose formal training was as limited as his life was short, burst upon the mathematical scene with a series of brilliant discoveries. Analytic number theory was among his specialties, and his publications carried titles such as “Highly composite numbers” and “Proof that almost all numbers <em>n</em> are composed of about log(log <em>n</em>) prime factors.”</p><!--[P5]--><span class="marker p5"></span><!--[AM5]--><span class="marker AM5 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD5]--><span class="marker MOD5 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">A legendary figure in 20th-century number theory was <span id="ref796482"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Paul-Erdos" class="md-crosslink">Paul Erdős</a> (1913–96), a Hungarian genius known for his deep insights, his vast circle of collaborators, and his personal eccentricities. At age 18, Erdős published a much-simplified <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/proof-logic" class="md-crosslink autoxref">proof</a> of a theorem of Chebyshev stating that, if <em>n</em> ≥ 2, then there must be a prime between <em>n</em> and 2<em>n</em>. This was the first in a string of number theoretic results that would span most of the century. In the process, Erdős—who also worked in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/combinatorics" class="md-crosslink">combinatorics</a>, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/graph-theory" class="md-crosslink">graph theory</a>, and <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="dimension" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/dimension" data-type="EB">dimension</a> theory—published over 1,500 papers with more than 500 collaborators from around the world. He achieved this astonishing output while living more or less out of a suitcase, traveling constantly from one university to another in pursuit of new mathematics. It was not uncommon for him to arrive, unannounced, with the declaration that “My brain is open” and then to plunge into the latest problem with gusto.</p><!--[P6]--><span class="marker p6"></span><!--[AM6]--><span class="marker AM6 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD6]--><span class="marker MOD6 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">Two later developments deserve mention. One was the invention of the electronic computer, whose speed has been advantageously applied to number theoretic questions. As an example, Euler once <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="speculated" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/speculated" data-type="EB">speculated</a> that at least four fourth powers must be added together for the sum to be a fourth power. But in 1988, using a combination of mathematical insight and computer muscle, the American <span id="ref796483"></span>Noam Elkies discovered that 2,682,440<sup>4</sup> + 15,365,639<sup>4</sup> + 18,796,760<sup>4</sup> = 20,615,673<sup>4</sup>—a stupendous counterexample that destroyed Euler’s conjecture. (The number on the right contains 30 digits, so there is little wonder that Euler missed it.)</p><!--[P7]--><span class="marker p7"></span><!--[AM7]--><span class="marker AM7 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD7]--><span class="marker MOD7 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">Second, number theory acquired an applied flavour, for it became instrumental in designing <span id="ref796035"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/cryptography" class="md-crosslink">encryption</a> schemes widely used in government and business. These rely upon the factorization of gigantic numbers into primes—a factorization that the code’s user knows and the potential code-breaker does not. This application runs counter to the long-held perception of number theory as beautiful but essentially useless. (<em>See</em> <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/cryptology/Product-ciphers#ref25632" class="md-crosslink">cryptology: Cryptography</a>.)</p><!--[P8]--><span class="marker p8"></span><!--[AM8]--><span class="marker AM8 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD8]--><span class="marker MOD8 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">Twentieth-century number theory reached a much-publicized climax in 1995, when <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Fermats-last-theorem" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Fermat’s last theorem</a> was proved by the Englishman <span id="ref796484"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrew-Wiles" class="md-crosslink">Andrew Wiles</a>, with <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="timely" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/timely" data-type="EB">timely</a> assistance from his British colleague Richard Taylor. Wiles succeeded where so many had failed with a 130-page proof of incredible complexity, one that certainly would not fit into any margin.</p><!--[P9]--><span class="marker p9"></span><!--[AM9]--><span class="marker AM9 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD9]--><span class="marker MOD9 mod-inline"></span> </section> <!--[H6]--><span class="marker h6"></span><section id="ref233908" data-level="1"> <h2 class="h1">Unsolved problems</h2> <p class="topic-paragraph">This triumph notwithstanding, number theory remains the source of many unsolved problems, some of the most perplexing of which sound innocent enough. For example:</p><!--[P10]--><span class="marker p10"></span><!--[AM10]--><span class="marker AM10 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD10]--><span class="marker MOD10 mod-inline"></span> <ol class="topic-list"><li><div>Do any odd perfect numbers exist?</div></li><li><div>Are there infinitely many primes of the form <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 1 (i.e., one more than a perfect square)?</div></li><li><div>Are there infinitely many pairs of twin primes (i.e., primes that differ by 2, like 5 and 7 or 41 and 43)?</div></li><li><div>Is <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Goldbach-conjecture" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Goldbach’s conjecture</a> true?

Perhaps, like Fermat’s last theorem, they will eventually be resolved. Or perhaps they will remain as challenges into the indefinite future. In order to spur research efforts across a wide range of mathematical <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="disciplines" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/disciplines" data-type="MW">disciplines</a>, the privately funded Clay Mathematics Institute of Cambridge, Massachusetts, named seven “Millennium Prize Problems” in 2000, each with a million-dollar award for a correct solution. In any case, these mysteries justify <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Eric-Temple-Bell" class="md-crosslink">Eric Temple Bell</a>’s characterization of number theory as “the last great uncivilized continent of mathematics.”</p><!--[P11]--><span class="marker p11"></span><!--[AM11]--><span class="marker AM11 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD11]--><span class="marker MOD11 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">The theory of numbers, then, is a vast and challenging subject as old as mathematics and as fresh as today’s news. Its problems retain their fascination because of an apparent (often deceptive) simplicity and an irresistible beauty. With such a rich and colorful history, number theory surely deserves to be called, in the famous words of Gauss, “the queen of mathematics.”</p><!--[P12]--><span class="marker p12"></span><!--[AM12]--><span class="marker AM12 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD12]--><span class="marker MOD12 mod-inline"></span> <span class="md-signature"><a href="/contributor/William-Dunham/5198">William Dunham</a></span> </section>  <!--[END-OF-CONTENT]--><span class="marker end-of-content"></span><!--[AFTER-ARTICLE]--><span class="marker after-article"></span></div>
