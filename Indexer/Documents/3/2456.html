Each biome and habitat comes with its own selection of flora and fauna, and it may include physical features such as canyons, volcanoes, rivers, or caves. Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest. Shifting trends in human migration have resulted in a human geography that is profoundly different from that of centuries ago.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg","altText":"Geography & Travel","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/17/2317-050-758D0E55/World-map-descriptions-Herodotus-Black-Sea.jpg"}},{"id":3000,"title":"Health & Medicine","urlTitle":"Health-Medicine","description":"The study of the human mind and body, how these function, and how they interact—not only with each other but also with their environment—has been of utmost importance in ensuring human well-being.

The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale.

The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next?

The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science.

The ancient Olympic Games are an early example of the contests in which humans have engaged to showcase physical prowess. In modern times, sports and games have evolved into a lucrative and competitive industry, while other leisure activities, such as card and video games, can be competitive or just serve as a way to unwind or socialize.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg","altText":"Sports & Recreation","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/13/170713-131-8D6B0AF7.jpg"}},{"id":2000,"title":"Technology","urlTitle":"Technology","description":"Humankind has long striven to improve its living conditions through the development of tools, instruments, and transportation and communications systems, all with the goal of making our lives easier, more productive and—why not?—more fun, too.

In the days of manual cryptography this was a useful device for the cryptographer, and in fact double transposition or product ciphers on key word-based rectangular matrices were widely used.

Since all participants must possess the same secret key, if they are physically separated—as is usually the case—there is the problem of how they get the key in the first place. <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="Diplomatic" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/Diplomatic" data-type="EB">Diplomatic</a> and military organizations traditionally use couriers to distribute keys for the highest-level communications systems, which are then used to superencrypt and distribute keys for lower-level systems. This is impractical, though, for most business and private needs. In addition, key holders are compelled to trust each other unconditionally to protect the keys in their possession and not to misuse them. Again, while this may be a tolerable condition in diplomatic and military organizations, it is almost never acceptable in the commercial realm.</p><!--[P3]--><span class="marker p3"></span><!--[AM3]--><span class="marker AM3 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD3]--><span class="marker MOD3 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">Another key distribution problem is the sheer number of keys required for flexible, secure communications among even a modest number of users. While only a single key is needed for secure <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/communication" class="md-crosslink autoxref">communication</a> between two parties, every potential pair of participants in a larger group needs a <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="unique" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/unique" data-type="EB">unique</a> key. To illustrate this point, consider an organization with only 1,000 users: each individual would need a different private key for each of the other 999 users. Such a system would require 499,500 different keys in all, with each user having to protect 999 keys. The number of different keys increases in proportion to the square of the number of users. Secure distribution for so many keys is simply insolvable, as are the demands on the users for the secure storage of their keys. In other words, symmetric key cryptography is impractical in a network in which all participants are equals in all respects. One “solution” is to create a trusted authority—unconditionally trusted by all users—with whom each user can communicate securely to generate and distribute temporary session keys as needed. Each user then has only to protect one key, while the burden for the protection of all of the keys in the network is shifted to the central authority.</p><!--[P4]--><span class="marker p4"></span><!--[AM4]--><span class="marker AM4 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD4]--><span class="marker MOD4 mod-inline"></span></section> <span id="ref233472" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref25632" data-level="3"><h2 class="h3"><span id="ref392531"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/public-key-cryptography" class="md-crosslink">Two-key cryptography</a></h2> <span id="ref233472" data-level="2"></span><section id="ref233473" data-level="4"><h2 class="h4">Public-key cryptography</h2> <p class="topic-paragraph">In 1976, in one of the most inspired insights in the history of cryptology, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sun-Microsystems-Inc" class="md-crosslink">Sun Microsystems, Inc.</a>, computer engineer <span id="ref392532"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Whitfield-Diffie" class="md-crosslink">Whitfield Diffie</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Stanford-University" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Stanford University</a> electrical engineer <span id="ref392533"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Martin-E-Hellman" class="md-crosslink">Martin Hellman</a> realized that the key distribution problem could be almost completely solved if a cryptosystem, <em>T</em> (and perhaps an <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="inverse" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/inverse" data-type="EB">inverse</a> system, <em>T</em>′), could be devised that used two keys and satisfied the following conditions:</p><!--[P5]--><span class="marker p5"></span><!--[AM5]--><span class="marker AM5 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD5]--><span class="marker MOD5 mod-inline"></span> <ol class="topic-list"><li><div>It must be easy for the cryptographer to calculate a matched pair of keys, <em>e</em> (encryption) and <em>d</em> (decryption), for which <em>T</em><sub><em>e</em></sub><em>T</em>′<sub><em>d</em></sub> = <em>I</em>.

Secrecy was not required, either in distributing or in storing this directory of “public” keys. Anyone wishing to communicate privately with a user whose key is in the directory only has to look up the recipient’s public key to encrypt a message that only the intended receiver can decrypt. The total number of keys involved is just twice the number of users, with each user having a key in the public directory and his own secret key, which he must protect in his own self-interest. Obviously, the public directory must be authenticated, otherwise <em>A</em> could be tricked into communicating with <em>C</em> when he thinks he is communicating with <em>B</em> simply by substituting <em>C</em>’s key for <em>B</em>’s in <em>A</em>’s copy of the directory. Since they were focused on the key distribution problem, Diffie and Hellman called their discovery public-key cryptography. This was the first discussion of two-key cryptography in the open literature. However, Admiral Bobby Inman, while director of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, revealed that two-key cryptography had been known to the agency almost a decade earlier, having been discovered by James Ellis, Clifford Cocks, and Malcolm Williamson at the British Government Code Headquarters (GCHQ).</p><!--[P6]--><span class="marker p6"></span><!--[AM6]--><span class="marker AM6 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD6]--><span class="marker MOD6 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">In this system, ciphers created with a secret key can be decrypted by anyone using the corresponding public key—thereby providing a means to identify the originator at the expense of completely giving up secrecy. Ciphers generated using the public key can only be decrypted by users holding the secret key, not by others holding the public key—however, the secret-key holder receives no information concerning the sender. In other words, the system provides secrecy at the expense of completely giving up any capability of authentication. What Diffie and Hellman had done was to separate the secrecy channel from the authentication channel—a striking example of the sum of the parts being greater than the whole. Single-key cryptography is called symmetric for obvious reasons. A cryptosystem satisfying conditions 1–4 above is called asymmetric for equally obvious reasons. There are symmetric cryptosystems in which the encryption and decryption keys are not the same—for example, matrix transforms of the text in which one key is a nonsingular (invertible) matrix and the other its inverse. Even though this is a two-key cryptosystem, since it is easy to calculate the inverse to a non-singular matrix, it does not satisfy condition 3 and is not considered to be asymmetric.</p><!--[P7]--><span class="marker p7"></span><!--[AM7]--><span class="marker AM7 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD7]--><span class="marker MOD7 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">Since in an asymmetric cryptosystem each user has a secrecy channel from every other user to him (using his public key) and an authentication channel from him to all other users (using his secret key), it is possible to achieve both secrecy and authentication using superencryption. Say <em>A</em> wishes to communicate a message in secret to <em>B</em>, but <em>B</em> wants to be sure the message was sent by <em>A</em>. <em>A</em> first encrypts the message with his secret key and then superencrypts the resulting cipher with <em>B</em>’s public key. The resulting outer cipher can only be decrypted by <em>B</em>, thus guaranteeing to <em>A</em> that only <em>B</em> can recover the inner cipher. When <em>B</em> opens the inner cipher using <em>A</em>’s public key he is certain the message came from someone knowing <em>A</em>’s key, presumably <em>A</em>. Simple as it is, this <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="protocol" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/protocol" data-type="MW">protocol</a> is a <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="paradigm" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/paradigm" data-type="MW">paradigm</a> for many contemporary applications.</p><!--[P8]--><span class="marker p8"></span><!--[AM8]--><span class="marker AM8 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD8]--><span class="marker MOD8 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">Cryptographers have constructed several cryptographic schemes of this sort by starting with a “hard” mathematical problem—such as factoring a number that is the product of two very large primes—and attempting to make the cryptanalysis of the scheme be equivalent to solving the hard problem. If this can be done, the cryptosecurity of the scheme will be at least as good as the underlying mathematical problem is hard to solve. This has not been proven for any of the candidate schemes thus far, although it is believed to hold in each instance.</p><!--[P9]--><span class="marker p9"></span><!--[AM9]--><span class="marker AM9 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD9]--><span class="marker MOD9 mod-inline"></span> <p class="topic-paragraph">However, a simple and secure proof of identity is possible based on such computational asymmetry. A user first secretly selects two large primes and then openly publishes their product. Although it is easy to compute a <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="modular" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/modular" data-type="EB">modular</a> <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/square-root" class="md-crosslink autoxref">square root</a> (a number whose square leaves a designated remainder when divided by the product) if the prime factors are known, it is just as hard as factoring (in fact equivalent to factoring) the product if the primes are unknown. A user can therefore prove his identity, i.e., that he knows the original primes, by demonstrating that he can extract modular square roots. The user can be confident that no one can impersonate him since to do so they would have to be able to factor his product.
