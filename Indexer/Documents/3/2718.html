<li><a id="section-viii-g"><a id="arbitration-waiver-of-class-action-suits-and-dispute-resolution"><strong>Arbitration, Waiver of Class Action Suits, and Dispute Resolution</strong>
THIS SECTION SHOULD BE BROADLY CONSTRUED TO COVER ANY CLAIM RELATING TO ANY ASPECT OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE AGREEMENT.
<ol>
<li>You agree that in the event you have any Claim against us, you will first contact us and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the Claim before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation arbitration or any court action. You may contact us through the means described on the Service, if available (for example, in the &quot;Contact Us&quot; section), or if no such means are specified, contact our <a href="mailto:privacy_administration@condenast.com">Privacy Policy Coordinator</a> as described in our <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
<li>In the event any CLAIM cannot be INFORMALLY resolved, YOU AND WE agree to arbitrate ALL CLAIMS on an individual basis in accordance with the terms of the arbitration provisions of this agreement, rather than litigate the CLAIM in court, except for the claims excluded from arbitration listed below in paragraph 7(D). Arbitration means You will have a fair hearing before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury. BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND WE EACH AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY FOR ALL CLAIMS, EXCEPT for the claims excluded from arbitration listed below in paragraph 7(d).
<ol>
<li>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules. For more information about the AAA and the arbitration process, please visit the AAA website at <a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>.</li>
<li>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA&#x27;s rules, except as follows: if your total Claims seek less than $10,000, we will reimburse you for filing fees you pay to the AAA.</li>
<li>All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except those issues relating to the scope, application, and enforceability of this arbitration provision are for the court to decide.</li>
<li>The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. The laws of the United States, State of New York, without regard to any principles of conflict of laws, applies to any arbitration under this section.</li>
<li>Unless you and we agree otherwise, any in-person hearings for the arbitration shall take place either in your county of principal residence or New York, New York.</li>
<li>The arbitrator&#x27;s ruling is binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</li>
<li>As indicated above in <a href="/user-agreement#section-viii-c-3">Section VIII(C)(3)</a>, this Agreement to Arbitrate shall survive any termination of the Agreement, including any termination of your relationship with us.</li>
</ol></li><li><strong>RESTRICTIONS ON CLAIMS:</strong><ol>
<li>AN ARBITRATION OF ANY CLAIM SUBJECT TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIM, OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS BARRED AND THE RIGHT TO PURSUE SUCH CLAIM IS WAIVED.</li>
<li><a id="section-viii-g-3-ii">BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN OR BRING A CLASS ACTION IN COURT OR A CLASS ARBITRATION. ALL PARTIES MUST BE INDIVIDUALLY NAMED. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED IN COURT ON A CLASS ACTION OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS ON BEHALF OF OTHER USERS, SUBSCRIBERS, REGISTRANTS OR OTHER PERSONS SIMILARLY SITUATED, OR BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL).</a></li>
<li>AS STATED MORE FULLY IN <a href="/user-agreement#section-viii-b-3">SECTION VIII(B(3)</a> ABOVE, ALL PARTIES WAIVE ANY CLAIM TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR MULTIPLIED DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR OUT OF ANY CLAIM WITH US.</li></ol></li>
<li>WE AND YOU AGREE THAT THE FOLLOWING WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION (&quot;EXCLUDED CLAIMS&quot;): (1) ANY CLAIM FILED BY YOU OR US IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT WHERE THE AMOUNT IN CONTROVERSY IS PROPERLY WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURT; AND (2) ANY CLAIM REGARDING ANY PARTY&#x27;S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.
</li>
<li>You further agree that for Excluded Claims and other Claims in which arbitration is denied:
<ol>
<li>the restrictions set forth in <a href="/user-agreement#section-viii-g-3-ii">Section VIII(G)(3)(ii)-(iii)</a> above shall apply;</li>
<li>regardless of where you access, visit and/or use the Service, such Claims shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, State of New York, without regard to any principles of conflict of laws; and</li>
<li>will be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in New York, New York, and you specifically consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and waive any claim of forum non-conveniens. Should there be a conflict between the laws of New York, and any other laws, the conflict will be resolved in favor of New York law.</li></ol></li>
<li>If for any reason an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Agreement, or portion thereof, to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision or portion will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to give effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of the Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable in full force and effect.
</li>
<li>IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING BY CONTACTING US AT THE ADDRESS BELOW WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST PURCHASE, SUBSCRIBE TO, OR REGISTER FOR THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT OR OTHERWISE ACCESS, VISIT AND/OR USE THE SERVICE.

IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY NOTIFIED US OF YOUR DECISION TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION AND THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO SO AGAIN.
