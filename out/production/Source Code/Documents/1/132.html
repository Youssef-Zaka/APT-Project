<h2><a name="genrich_altshuller"></a>Genrich Altshuller's<br />
Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TSIP or TRIZ)
</h2>
<h2><small>
<p style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Synopsis [1]
</p>
</small></h2>

<p>Genrich Altshuller set out a method of
systematically approaching the task of inventiveness. He
aimed this work at the engineer but noted that the principles can be
transposed to the organization of creative thinking in any sphere of
human activity.</p>
<br />

<p>He notes that people have been inventive
for a long time but that the technique which has ben employed was that
of selecting variants (.. what if we do this ..). This way of
approaching problem solving is dependent really on a multitude of fortuitous
factors which are difficult to comprehend or control.</p>

<p>He notes that people have been inventive for a long time but that the 
technique which has been employed was that of selecting
variants (.. what if we do this ..). This way of approaching
problem solving is dependent really on a multitude of fortuitous
factors which are difficult to comprehend or control.</p>
<br />

<p>He sets out the historical development of problem solving
techniques and proposes a method which is founded on a
step-by-step analysis of a problem to break
it down into simple essential parts and identifying
the technical contradictions. These contradictions
are resolved by testing&nbsp;forty basic methods to change variants
and ten classes of solutions of more complex problems. An example
of a basic method is the "Go Between" Principle which introduces an
intermediate object to transmit an action. &nbsp;An example of a
class of solutions is to introduce an additive to expose a difficult to
see object.</p>
<br />

<p>As a personal motivation, Altshuller observes "[w]hat can be
more alluring than the discovery of the nature of talented thought and
converting this talented thinking
from occasional and fleeting flashes into a powerful and controllable
fire of knowledge".<br />

<p style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Brief
Biography [2, 3]
</p>
</small></h2>
<p>Genrich Saulovich Altshuller, was born on the 15th of October 1926 in
Taskent, then the capital of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist
Republic. His family moved to Baku in Azerbaijan in 1931.</p>
<br />
</p>
<p>He showed an inventive nature while still in high school and graduated
with honours. He then enrolled in the Azerbaijan Industrial
Institute but&nbsp; in 1944 he enlisted in the Army. The
war ended before he was ready to take part in combat operations and he
was then assigned to the Commission on Innovations of the Caspian Navy
Flotilla. There he developed the idea that there were principles behind
inventiveness and he set out in 1946 to uncover these and began
teaching these principles in 1948.</p>
<br />
<p>From 1948 to 1954 he was sentenced to twenty five years in a labour
camp for what was perceived as criticism of the state but continued his
education in the evenings, being taught by academics who were also
interned. He was released in 1955, as a part of the reforms after
Joseph Stalin's death, and returned to Baku. </p>
<br />
<p>In 1956 he published his first paper, co-authored with Rafail Shapiro,
entitled "On the Psychology of inventiveness". In 1957-1959 he worked
in the Ministry of Construction of Azerbaijan and in 1958, held the
first ever seminar on TRIZ. He continued to develop the
theories underpinning TRIZ, set up schools and courses on it, and
publishing numerous books on the topic.</p>
