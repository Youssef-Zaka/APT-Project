Accordingly, we suggest that you check this page periodically. To make your periodic review more convenient, we will post a date at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p><strong>Collecting Site Visitor Information (including use of Cookies and Web Beacons)</strong></p>

<p>A cookie is a small text file containing information that a web site&nbsp;transfers to your computer for recordkeeping purposes. Cookies are used for running the Services, and are used to track you within the Services.</p>

<p>A web beacon is a transparent, 1-pixel image in .gif format that helps us&nbsp;collect data about visitors viewing a web page -- for example, to count the&nbsp;number of visitors to a page or to deliver a cookie to visitors&#39; browsers when&nbsp;they view that page. We may use web beacons on the Services from time to time for&nbsp;these and other purposes.</p>

<p>When you visit the Services or click on internal links within the Services, we may collect information through technologies such as cookies and beacons.&nbsp; By using the Services, you consent to any such collection and use of this information as described in this Privacy Statement.</p>

<p>We may use the information we gather to, among other things, help us improve our understanding of how visitors use the Services, measure interest in various pages, improve the Services&rsquo; content and usability, monitor the level of activity on the Services, and run the Services more efficiently. We may also use such information for other purposes, including as a way to gather broad demographic information, to enhance users&#39; experience on our Services, or to better prepare future content based on the interests of the users of our Services.&nbsp; However, we are not using these technologies to monitor or track you for advertising purposes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Use of these Technologies by&nbsp;Authorized Third Party Service Providers</strong></p>

<p>As described in our&nbsp;Terms of Use, we may be working with Third Party Providers (as defined in the&nbsp;Terms of Use) with respect to the Services.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those Third Party Providers may place third-party cookies, web beacons, or&nbsp;similar technologies for storing information in our Services. These Third Party Providers may use these technologies in connection with the provision of the&nbsp;Services and/or to compile anonymous site metrics and analytics.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Collecting Your Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>In order for you to deposit Materials or use certain parts of the Services, we may require you to provide us with information that personally identifies you. &nbsp;This information may include, without limitation, contact data like your name and email address.&nbsp; If you make an account to use certain Services, communicate with us by e-mail through any links on the Services, or otherwise complete online forms or otherwise submit information through the Services, any information provided in such communication may be collected.&nbsp; CMU may receive such information directly from you and/or through others involved in the Services (such as from Third Party Providers). &nbsp;In addition, Materials being deposited may contain certain personal information (including but not limited to names of authors).</p>

<p><strong>Choice Regarding Collection of Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>You may choose not to provide any individually-identifiable information.&nbsp; In such an event, you may not be able to deposit Materials or use those portions of our Services that require you to have an account or otherwise provide such individually-identifiable information.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How We Use and Share Information Collected</strong></p>

<p>We will use information collected from you to, among other things, provide and/or enable your use of the Services, contact you when necessary, and ensuring your compliance with the&nbsp;Terms of Use. &nbsp;&nbsp;Among other things, you understand that if Materials contain personally identifiable information and you deposit them in the Repository, you are authorizing CMU to release such Materials (including any personally identifiable information in them) through the Repository.</p>

<p>CMU may also provide such information or provide access to such information to any of our affiliates, licensors, content providers, contractors (including but not limited to Third Party Providers) and sponsors.</p>

<p>CMU may use your information to reply to you and send information to you.&nbsp; CMU also may provide aggregated information received from Services users to third parties.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Regarding any of your personally identifiable information collected by CMU through the Services, CMU will not sell or rent such personally identifiable information to third parties for the third parties&rsquo; commercial marketing purposes.</p>

<p>In the event that some of CMU&rsquo;s assets and/or information are sold or transferred or used as security, the information collected through our Services may be transferred to third parties as part of that transaction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If CMU is requested by law enforcement officials or judicial authorities to provide information on individual users, we may, without your consent, provide such information.&nbsp; In any matters involving claims of personal or public safety (as determined by CMU in its sole discretion) CMU may provide your personal information to appropriate authorities without your consent or court process.&nbsp; CMU may also use your information to enforce CMU&rsquo;s rights, intellectual property or other property, including but not limited to enforcing the&nbsp;Terms of Use.</p>

<p>CMU does not intend to reveal your personally-identifiable information to third parties except in the ways described in this Privacy Statement or as otherwise authorized by you.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Your Ability to Access, Update and Correct Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>If you wish to check the personal information we have at CMU that was collected through the Services, please email us at KiltHub@andrew.cmu.edu.&nbsp; We may retain in our files information you have requested to remove in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and/or enforce our&nbsp;Terms of Use.&nbsp; In addition, such prior information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact that we back up our systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.</p>

<p><strong>Children&#39;s Privacy</strong></p>

<p>Protecting children&#39;s privacy is extremely important to us. Our Services are not intended for the use of or designed to attract the attention of children.

<p><strong>Other Sites</strong></p>

<p>Links to third-party web sites may appear on some pages within the Services for your convenience and information. Using these links will cause you to access web sites that are not part of the Services. We suggest that you carefully review the privacy policies of each site you visit.&nbsp;</p>
