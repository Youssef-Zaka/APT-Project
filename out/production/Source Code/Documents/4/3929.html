==== Regions and countries&lt;!--'Muir Island' redirects here--> ====
* [[Atlantis]]: Atlantis was a small [[continent]] with many human settlements. Over 21,000 years ago, an event called the "Great Cataclysm" caused it to be submerged into the sea. The inhabitants of ancient Atlantis built an enormous glass-like dome over the capital city, also known as Atlantis. When barbarians sent by the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] Lemuria empire attacked Atlantis, King [[Kamuu]] opened the magma-pits which were the city's means of heating. This caused the continent to sink.&lt;ref>''The Sub-Mariner'' #62, "Tales of Atlantis" backup story. Written by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Howard Chaykin]].&lt;/ref> Kamuu was warned of the Great Cataclysm by the seer, Zhered-Na. When she refused to recant, he had her exiled to the mainland, where she was later stabbed to death by survivors of the submersion.&lt;ref>''Fear'' #15&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #17&lt;/ref>
* &lt;span id="Attilan">'''Attilan'''&lt;/span> (also called the Hidden Land): Home of the [[Inhumans]]. Originally an island in the North Atlantic Ocean, it has moved several times, including to the Andes, Himalayas, to the Blue Area of the Moon, and to the homeworld of the alien [[Kree]], Hala. Attilan is destroyed during the events of ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' by [[Black Bolt]] when he detonates the Terrigen Bomb. The remains of Attilan subsequently reside within New York, in the Hudson estuary. The remains become a sovereign state, New Attilan, ruled by [[Medusa (Marvel Comics)|Medusa]].
** '''Attilan in other media'''
*** '''Animation'''
**** Attilan appears in ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode "Inhuman Nature". [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] takes [[Rick Jones (character)|A-Bomb]], who falls in love with her. [[Hulk]], [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]], [[She-Hulk]] and [[Skaar (comics)|Skaar]] track him down and meet the Inhumans upon being captured, but they break free to stop [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]] from using a weapon that he plans to destroy humanity. Failing, Atillan is locked in a barrier by Maximus that protects the city Attilan, from the rest of the world, but is ultimately destroyed by Black Bolt.
**** Attilan appears in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man: Web-Warriors]]'', episode "Inhumanity". The city is controlled by Maximus as king to destroy humanity. But [[Spider-Man]] and [[Triton (comics)|Triton]] defeated him and with the help of Black Bolt, Atillan fell back.
**** Attilan appears in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', episode "Crystal Blue Persuasion", when [[Ronan the Accuser]] makes a deal with Maximus using terrifying crystals with the Inhumans, and episode "Inhuman Touch", the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] go to Attilan again to speak with Maximus about the location of the Cosmic Seed, until he plans to escape his cell to control it and destroy any nearby planet.
**** Attilan appears in ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]''. In season 3, episode "Inhumans Among Us", it is said that the Hulk knows of them, when Inhuman Royal Family arrive from facing the Avengers and help them stop the Terrigena plague of Primitive Alphas and an emerged inhuman called [[Inferno (Dante Pertuz)|Inferno]]. In episode, "The Inhuman Condition", Atillan city is taken over by [[Ultron]] and using the Inhumans to create a dangerous weapon on Earth and at the end, the fog spreads on Earth and Atillan lands to search for new Inhumans. In "Civil War, Part 1: The Fall of Attilan", after the Avengers capture Maximus and bring him to Attilan, he causes Inferno to enrage and destroy all of Attilan. Truman Marsh goes ahead with the Inhumans Registration Act where the Inhumans will have inscription discs imposed on them after the destruction of Atillan. At the end of "Civil War, Part 4: Avengers Revolution", Attilan is rebuilt again. In season 5, episode "Mists of Attilan", [[Black Panther (character)|Black Panther]] take [[Kamala Khan|Ms. Marvel]] on a mission to Attilan.
**** Attilan appears in the second season of ''[[Marvel Future Avengers]]''. Following an outbreak of Terrigen Mist, the Inhumans claim custody of the afflicted and take them to Attilan. As a result, the Avengers, Future Avengers and Ms. Marvel attempt to broker peace between Earth and Attilan in order to reunite those taken with their families on Earth.
***'''Live action'''
**** In ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', in the middle of season 2, Gordon, an Inhuman, reveals to the already transformed, Raina that there is an island not explored by man where Inhumans live, implying that he refers to Attilan, being this is his first reference in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] and a support to appear in the Inhumans series at the end of 2017. The "Beyond", is the home of the Inhumans on Earth located in the mountain range of [[China]] and is isolated from society and led by Inhuman elders and Jiaying before its collapse during the war with S.H.I.E.L.D. similarity with the version "The Great Refuge" of Attilan, which is also found in the mountain range of China.
**** It was confirmed that Marvel will produce a TV series, ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Inhumans]]'', scheduled for release in 2017. At some point in history, a civilization of Inhumans decided to leave Earth to colonize on the Moon. They built the city of Attilan in a protective dome, protecting it and keeping it hidden from humans and Kree. After Triton's disappearance, Maximus started the revolution by taking over Atillan and causing the royal family (Black Bolt, Medusa, [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]], [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], Crystal and [[Lockjaw (comics)|Lockjaw]]) to escape to Earth and send his allies to pursue them. In the series finale, Attilan's protective dome had been compromised by Maximus's plan to retain control and ultimately collapsed. Fortunately, the royal family was able to organize an evacuation to Earth to save the people of Attilan, with the help of NASA. The destruction of Attilan seemed to send a signal to Hala, or possibly another Kree outpost. This may indicate the imminent danger that Black Bolt warned Medusa about. With the help of the humans, Black Bolt and Medusa led the Inhumans to build a new Attilan on Earth.
* Bagalia: Bagalia is a sovereign [[Island country|island nation]] in an undisclosed location that was established by the Shadow Council. It is ruled by criminals and populated by the Shadow Council's incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]].

When the Deviants attacked Atlantis, the Atlantean King Kamuu opened the magma-pits which were the city's means of heating. This caused a chain reaction which collapsed and sank the continent.

=====Alcatraz=====
[[Alcatraz Island|Alcatraz]] is a real-life island prison in San Francisco Bay that was operational in 1859–1963.

Later seen in ''Human Torch'' #8 (1942), when the golden age [[Angel (Thomas Halloway)|Angel]]'s foe the Python escaped.

During the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, Alcatraz was occupied by [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]], who used it as a detention center for the mutants that the Dark Avengers apprehended.

During the "[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]" storyline, Iron Man used Alcatraz as the site of Stark Island.

Some of its most notable inmates include the Mad Thinker, Whirlwind, Grey Gargoyle, and members of the Serpent Society. The placement within the Helicarrier proves disastrous in the series premiere, [[Breakout (The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes)|"Breakout"]], as a massive prison escape across several superhuman penitentiaries results in the Big House growing to full size, causing enough internal damage to cause the Helicarrier to crash.

=====Project Pegasus&lt;!--'Project Pegasus' redirects here-->=====
Created in ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #42 (Aug. 1978) by writers [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Ralph Macchio (comics)|Ralph Macchio]], '''Project Pegasus'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> ('''P'''otential '''E'''nergy '''G'''roup, '''A'''lternate '''S'''ources, '''U'''nited '''S'''tates) was originally intended to research alternative (and unusual) forms of energy. It was later used as a [[prison]] for super-powered individuals with energy-based powers. It was originally located in the [[Adirondack Mountains]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

Several heroes have served terms working security at the facility, including the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]. At one time, it also served as a temporary home for the [[Squadron Supreme]] when they were exiled from their own universe.

In the ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' reality, P.E.G.A.S.U.S. appeared in the series [[Ultimate Power]].&lt;ref name="Ultimate Power #1">''Ultimate Power'' #1&lt;/ref> This Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S was located in Devil's Point, [[Wyoming]]. It was a S.H.I.E.L.D. program that served to store all objects of mysterious origin or unexplained power that United States authorities had accumulated over the years, in which every precaution was made to keep the objects safe. Originally, Project Pegasus was the center of "S.H.I.E.L.D.'s universe" (something that the recent directors of S.H.I.E.L.D., [[Carol Danvers]] and Nick Fury, were completely unaware of). It was later reduced to a storage house, but still kept some of the original facility which included an underground laboratory.&lt;ref>''Ultimate Comics: Doom'' #3&lt;/ref> Project Pegasus was attacked two times by the [[Serpent Squad]], who had come for the Serpent Crown that was stored there, and was protected by the [[Fantastic Four]], Spider-Man, [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], and [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]].&lt;ref name="Ultimate Power #1"/>&lt;ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #8&lt;/ref> P.E.G.A.S.U.S. also housed the Watcher [[Uatu]] after it was discovered by American personnel at Project Rebirth, until Uatu was "activated" and forewarned the Fantastic Four, Carol Danvers, and P.E.G.A.S.U.S.'s overseer, [[Wendell Vaughn]], about an upcoming cataclysm before it disappeared.&lt;ref>''Ultimate Origin'' #5&lt;/ref> Following the events of [[Ultimatum (comics)|Ultimatum]], Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. was put on alert in the wake of unexplained attacks on the [[Baxter Building]] and [[Roxxon|Roxxon Industries]]. P.E.G.A.S.U.S.'s personnel were aided by [[Mahr Vehl|Captain Mahr-Vehl]], but Mahr-Vehl was infected with an unknown virus and went berserk, attacking P.E.G.A.S.U.S. personnel. Mahr-Vehl was transported away by Rick Jones/[[Nova (comics)|Nova]], but that left Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. vulnerable. It was invaded by the true instigator of the attacks, [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Reed Richards]], who pilfered the facility's valuable possessions.&lt;ref>''Ultimate Comics: Doom'' #2&lt;/ref>&lt;ref>''Ultimate Comics: Mystery'' #3&lt;/ref>

======Project Pegasus in other media======
* Project: Pegasus appears in ''[[Iron Man Armored Adventures]]'', led by Russian scientist Anton Harchov.

* P.E.G.A.S.U.S. appears in media related to the ''[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]''.
** In ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'', it is a joint venture between the [[United States Air Force]] and [[NASA]] housed at an Air Force base before S.H.I.E.L.D. took over the Air Force's position, to investigate phenomena beyond the range of conventional scientific understanding. Both major contributors provided scientific expertise to the project, and due to the highly sensitive nature of the research conducted there, S.H.I.E.L.D. also provided its security force. It is also where [[Mar-Vell|Dr. Wendy Lawson]] experimented on a new drive to help transport a group of refugee [[Skrulls]]. Project: P.E.G.A.S.U.S. played host to the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]] for many years.
** By the early 21st century and the events of ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', S.H.I.E.L.D. had determined that it was an incredible source of energy, but found no way to tap it. This changed when S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Nick Fury]] found Culver University Professor [[Erik Selvig]], and brought him in to investigate the object. Upon seeing it, he was influenced by [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] to help them.
** As of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', Selvig came to a rudimentary understanding of the Tesseract's capabilities. Following an attack by Loki however, Project: P.E.G.A.S.U.S. was hastily evacuated, though the unrestrained energies released from Loki's escape erupted and consumed the Project: P.E.G.A.S.U.S. facility, leaving a vast crater in its wake.

====Planets====
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Planets in science fiction]] -->
* Counter-Earth: There have been four versions of the hypothetical planet known as Counter-Earth, each one a near-duplicate of Earth.
** High Evolutionary's Counter-Earth: The first Counter-Earth was created by the High Evolutionary with the help of at least some of the Infinity Gems as part of his "Project Alpha". The High Evolutionary artificially creates a Counter-Earth specifically located to hide it from "True Earth", on which he has greatly accelerated evolution and the passage of time.
** Goddess's Counter-Earth: The second Counter-Earth, dubbed Paradise Omega, was created by the Goddess using the Cosmic Egg, a collection of 30 Cosmic Cubes.
** Franklin Richards's Counter-Earth: The third Counter-Earth was created by Franklin Richards in the transition from the Onslaught storyline to the Heroes Reborn event. As Franklin watched the Fantastic Four, Avengers and others sacrifice their lives to defeat Onslaught, he unwittingly tapped into his latent cosmic power to create a pocket universe and divert the heroes there to prevent their deaths. On the Earth of this new dimension, the heroes relived altered versions of their pasts, unaware of their previous lives in the "mainstream" Marvel Universe, where they were presumed dead.
** Onslaught Reborn Counter-Earth: The fourth Counter-Earth was also created by Franklin Richards after the events of House of M unexpectedly resurrected Onslaught, who immediately resumed his mission to appropriate the power of Franklin Richards. To elude Onslaught, Franklin transported himself, the Fantastic Four, and several of the Avengers to a reality resembling the circumstances of Heroes Reborn, where the heroes had no memory of their Earth-616 lives.

* Blue Area of the Moon: An artificial, self-sustaining, Earth-like environment on the near side of the [[Moon]], the Blue Area was created roughly 1 million years ago as part of a competition between two alien races, the [[Kree]] and the [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]]. The [[Skrull]]s, then a benevolent race, moderated this contest, whose goal was to determine the worthiness of both races by discovering which could achieve more within a set period of time. After being taken to the area of Earth's Moon where the Skrulls had created the artificial atmosphere, the Kree used their strength and rudimentary Skrull technology to create a giant city, while the Cotati were taken to another barren world in a different solar system where they created a long-term sustainable [[ecosystem]]. Learning that the Cotati were going to win the contest, the enraged Kree first slaughtered the Cotati and then attacked and killed the Skrull delegation, stole their [[starship]], and initiated the millennia-long conflict now known as the [[Kree-Skrull War]], which would force the Skrulls to become a society of warriors.&lt;ref>''The Avengers'' #133 (March 1975)&lt;/ref> The Blue Area of the Moon was also the home of Uatu the Watcher and a brief location for Attilan.

====Outer space prisons====
The following prisons are located in outer space:

=====Anvil=====
'''Anvil''' is a penal colony on the planet Annoval XIV. It was the site of an attempted breakout by Nebula. First appeared in ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' #74 (1993).

=====Kyln=====
The Kyln were a series of artificial moons at the edge of known space, which served both as a superhuman prison and a source of nearly unlimited power. Operations at the Kyln were overseen by the [[Nova Corps]]. All life on the Kyln moons was extinguished in ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]] Prologue'' #1.

======Kyln in other media======
The Kyln appears as a Nova Corps prison in the film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''. Before coming together, the members of the Guardians of the Galaxy had been imprisoned here alongside other unnamed inmates where some of them have personal issues with Gamora. The Kyln was later destroyed by Nebula on Ronan the Accuser's orders to "cleanse" it.

=====Negative Zone Prison Alpha=====
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Mister Fantastic]] -->
Introduced in ''[[Civil War: Front Line|Civil War: Frontline]]'' #5, it is a prison originally constructed to house super-villains but which acted as a holding facility for unregistered heroes during the civil war. The portal to the prison is operated by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents. The prison itself is an automated facility. Designed by [[Reed Richards]] and built by [[Tony Stark|Stark Enterprises]] and Fantastic Four Inc., it is located in the [[Negative Zone]]. The inmates call the facility "[[Fantasy Island (1977 TV series)|Fantasy Island]]" and "Wonderland", probably because prisoners who are unable to manipulate technology to their own ends are connected to [[virtual reality]] systems.

It is also referred to as "File 42" due to it being the 42nd item on a list written by [[Tony Stark]], [[Reed Richards]] and [[Hank Pym]] of ways to make a world with super-powered beings safer. The prison is an extremely secure, clean facility with cells custom-designed for each inhabitant. Notable inmates during the war include [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] ([[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] stand-in), [[Robbie Baldwin]] and [[Cloak and Dagger (characters)|Cloak and Dagger]]. After the war, it is now used for super-villains, and was known to house at the very least [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and [[Lady Deathstrike]] until Taskmaster made a deal with Camp Hammond to become an instructor and Lady Deathstrike somehow escaped as she appeared in X-Men: Messiah Complex. However, the prison was later overrun by Negative Zone ruler [[Blastaar]].

======Negative Zone Prison Alpha in other media======
Prison 42 appears in the ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' season 2 episode "Assault on 42", without the Civil War background as the event never happened in the cartoon's continuity. Instead, it simply serves as a new prison for superpowered individuals which is eventually attacked by [[Annihilus]].

=====Stockade=====
A 31st-century prison planet in the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] universe, shown in ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #21 and #51–53. Known inmates of Stockade have included [[Charlie-27]], Tork and Teju.

(Genetically Engineered Neural Intelligence Experiment), was examining alien technology and corpses discovered by U.S. soldiers during the [[Vietnam War]], when some unknown event caused the corpses to release a cloud of material which caused G.E.N.I.E. to develop [[sentience]] and grow into a true fusion of organic and mechanical technology.

* The '''{{visible anchor|Staff of One|SoO}}''': A powerful magical staff used by the runaway [[Nico Minoru]]. Whenever Nico bleeds, the staff emerges from her chest, allowing Nico to bend magic.
* [[Stormbreaker (comics)|Stormbreaker]]: The hammer of Beta Ray Bill.
* {{anchor|Twilight Sword|TS}}The '''[[Twilight sword]]''': The weapon of the giant [[Surtur (character)|Surtur]].
* The '''{{visible anchor|Wand of Watoomb}}''': An artifact controlled by the thoughts of the wielder, and can be used to project and absorb mystical energy; create [[Force field (fiction)|force fields]]; control weather; open dimensional portals; observe events in other locations and heal wounds. Used thousands of years before the modern era by [[priest]]ess of the [[god]] Yog against the [[barbarian]] [[Conan (Marvel Comics)|Conan]], it is sought out by Xandu in modern times to destroy [[Doctor Strange]].
