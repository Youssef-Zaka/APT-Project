But a big coronavirus outbreak could be devastating in a country with a broken health care system and an unvaccinated, malnourished population. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">The North’s Korean Central News Agency said of the 350,000 people who developed fevers since late April, 162,200 have recovered. It said 18,000 people were newly found with fever symptoms on Thursday alone, and 187,800 are being isolated for treatment.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">One of the six people who died was infected with the omicron variant, KCNA said. But it wasn’t immediately clear how many of the total illnesses were COVID-19.</p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-92"><div class="Component-adTitle-0-2-50">ADVERTISEMENT</div><div class="Component-placeholderWrapper-0-2-53"><div class="Component-visualPlaceholder-0-2-51"></div><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad_site_article_midarticle1" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-49"></div></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-97 Component-p-0-2-88">North Korea imposed a lockdown Thursday after acknowledging its first COVID-19 cases.

He took off the mask and smoked a cigarette while talking with officials. \u003c/p>\u003cp>KCNA said Kim criticized officials for failing to prevent “a vulnerable point in the epidemic prevention system.” He said the outbreak was centered around the capital, Pyongyang, and stressed all work and residential units should be isolated from one another while residents should be provided every convenience during the lockdown.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='736b9fb9e68b4b36911fe3647e81135a' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“It is the most important challenge and supreme tasks facing our party to reverse the immediate public health crisis situation at an early date, restore the stability of epidemic prevention and protect the health and wellbeing of our people,” KCNA quoted Kim as saying.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The spread of the virus may have been accelerated by a massive military parade on April 25, where Kim gave a speech and showcased his army and weaponry in front of tens of thousands of people. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Cheong Seong-Chang, an analyst at South Korea’s Sejong Institute, said the pace of the fever's spread suggests the crisis could last months and possibly into 2023, causing major disruption in the poorly equipped country. \u003c/p>\u003cp>According to the latest figures from the World Health Organization, North Korea reported to the U.N. agency that it tested 64,207 people for COVID-19 in 2020 through March 22 this year, a small number that may indicate insufficient tests for a population of 26 million. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>North Korea also lacks vaccines, COVID-19 antiviral pills and has likely very few intensive care units to treat serious cases, which may cause higher death rates than other nations, experts say. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The North last year \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-coronavirus-pandemic-coronavirus-vaccine-4eb4e5ca2732e4f168563040f53764db\">shunned \u003c/a> millions of shots offered by the U.N.-backed COVAX distribution program, including doses of AstraZeneca and China’s Sinovac vaccines, possibly because of questions about their effectiveness and unwillingness to accept monitoring requirements.

It said the North hasn't yet asked for its help. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Cha Deok-cheol, a spokesperson in South Korea's Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, said Seoul doesn’t immediately have an estimate on the number of vaccine doses it could offer to North Korea. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Inter-Korean relations have deteriorated over the past three years as larger nuclear negotiations remain stalled since they broke down over disagreements about U.S.-led sanctions and the North's disarmament steps.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Beijing was ready to offer North Korea help but said he had no information about any such request being made. Asked whether China would be evacuating its nationals from North Korea, Zhao said Beijing will closely monitor the situation and maintain communication with the North to ensure the health and safety of Chinese citizens there. \u003c/p>\u003cp>North Korea's claim of a perfect record in keeping out the virus for 2 1/2 years was widely doubted. But its extremely strict border closure, large-scale quarantines and propaganda that stressed anti-virus controls as a matter of “national existence” may have staved off a huge outbreak until now.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Hours after confirming the outbreak, North Korea launched three short-range \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/seoul-south-korea-north-327a81d1281f2fadeb430e4c632458b7\">ballistic missiles\u003c/a> toward the sea in an apparent display of strength.
